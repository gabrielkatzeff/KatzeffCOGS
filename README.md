# KatzeffCOGS
An overview of my programming experience throughout my cognitive neuroscience degree.

## COMP1000: Introduction to Computer Programming
I completed COMP1000 in semester 2 of 2021, achieving a High Distinction (90/100). 

The course followed Daniel Schiffman's 'Learning Processing' textbook, and covered:
1. Primitive operations and algorithms
2. Variables, debugging
3. Conditions
4. Loops
5. Functions
6. Scope
7. Compound Data
8. Reference Semantics
9. Refactoring

Throughout, we had the opportunity to use [Processing]([url](https://processing.org/download)), which has a beginner friendly UI and outputs graphics to the display. 
All of the examples included here are executable in Processing and generate a graphical output. 


## COGS2020: Experimental Design and Data Analysis for the Cognitive and Brain Sciences
We practiced using R and the data table package to analyse statistical information related to cognitive science experiments. 
We followed this course structure, https://github.com/crossley/cogs2020, I achieved 86/100 for this unit. 
* Descriptive statistics, data types, experiment design
* probability, random variables, confidence intervals
* Binomial Distribution, Binomial Tests
* Normal Distribution, Normal Tests
* T-distribution, single and two-sample T-Tests
* One-way and Two-way ANOVAs by hand and using R
* Repeated measures and mixed design ANOVA by hand and using R
* Simple and multiple linear regression

## COGS2030: Hearing and Brain
A major component of this unit was learning MATLAB to perform digital signal processing. The final coding assessment for this unit is attatched, I achieved 87/100 for this unit and 99% in the coding component.
We covered:
1. Arrays in MATLAB
2. Control flow structures, e.g., if...end, if...elseif, while
3. Modifying different signal types, e.g., continous and discrete sine waves
4. Reading and analysing audio data in MATLAB
5. Discrete and Fast-Fourier Transforms, time and frequency representations. Plotting power spectral density functions. 
6. Digital filters, the cochlea as a gamma-tone filterbank
7. Custom pre-processing in MATLAB
8. Custom filter design in MATLAB
9. Fundamental frequency estimation
10. Speech and formamt analysis
