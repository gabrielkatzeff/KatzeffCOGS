# KatzeffCOGS
An overview of my programming experience throughout my cognitive neuroscience degree.

## COMP1000: Introduction to Computer Programming
I completed COMP1000 in semester 2 of 2021, achieving a High Distinction (90/100). 

The course followed Daniel Schiffman's 'Learning Processing' textbook, and covered:
* Primitive operations and algorithms
* Variables, debugging
* Conditions
* Loops
* Functions
* Scope
* Compound Data
* Reference Semantics
* Refactoring

Throughout, we had the opportunity to use [Processing]([url](https://processing.org/download)), which has a beginner friendly UI and outputs graphics to the display. 
All of the examples included here are executable in Processing and generate a graphical output. 


## COGS2020: Experimental Design and Data Analysis for the Cognitive and Brain Sciences
We practiced using R and the data table package to analyse statistical information related to cognitive science experiments. 
We followed this course structure, https://github.com/crossley/cogs2020, I achieved 86/100 for this unit. The homework examples are not included here as they make little sense without the data tables provided. 
* Descriptive statistics, data types, experiment design
* probability, random variables, confidence intervals
* Binomial Distribution, Binomial Tests
* Normal Distribution, Normal Tests
* T-distribution, single and two-sample T-Tests
* One-way and Two-way ANOVAs by hand and using R
* Repeated measures and mixed design ANOVA by hand and using R
* Simple and multiple linear regression

We cleansed datasets and performed hypothesis tests using R. 

## COGS2250: Cognitive and Brain Sciences Laboratory
As a cohort we participated in and analysed behavioural and neuroimaging data from a semantic priming experiment. We programmed the experimental stimulus using PsychoPy, processed the data in R, performed statistical analysis in Jamovi, and correlated our results in MATLAB with an EEG waveform.

## COGS2030: Hearing and Brain
A major component of this unit was learning MATLAB to perform digital signal processing. The final coding assessment for this unit is attatched, I achieved 87/100 for this unit and 99% in the coding component.
We covered:
* Arrays in MATLAB
* Control flow structures, e.g., if...end, if...elseif, while
* Modifying different signal types, e.g., continous and discrete sine waves
* Reading and analysing audio data in MATLAB
* Discrete and Fast-Fourier Transforms, time and frequency representations. Plotting power spectral density functions. 
* Digital filters, the cochlea as a gamma-tone filterbank
* Custom pre-processing in MATLAB
* Custom filter design in MATLAB
* Fundamental frequency estimation
* Speech and formant analysis
