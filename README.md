An overview of my programming experience throughout my cognitive neuroscience degree.

## COMP1000: Introduction to Computer Programming
I completed COMP1000 in semester 2 of 2021, achieving a High Distinction (90/100). 

The course followed Daniel Schiffman's 'Learning Processing' textbook, and covered:
1. Primitive operations and algorithms
2. Variables, debugging
3. Conditions
4. Loops
5. Functions
6. Scope
7. Compound Data
8. Reference Semantics
9. Refactoring

Throughout, we had the opportunity to use [Processing]([url](https://processing.org/download)), which has a beginner friendly UI and outputs graphics to the display. 
All of the examples included here are executable in Processing and generate a graphical output.
