Crowdstrike Global Threat Report 2023 <

The latest edition of the CrowdStrike Global Threat Report comes at an important
time for protectors around the world. As organizations focus on managing remote
and hybrid teams, operationalizing years of digital transformation and navigating
an uncertain global economy, adversaries have become more sophisticated, relentless
and damaging in their attacks. As a result, a number of disruptive trends emerged in 2022
that threaten productivity and global stability. 

The year started ominously as Russia’s deadly war of aggression in Ukraine brought about
a terrible human toll, threatened international order and put countless global organizations
at risk of spillover cyberattacks. At the same time, China state-nexus adversaries ramped up
their cyber espionage campaigns, and Iranian actors launched destructive “lock-and-leak”
operations using ransomware.

These growing nation-state attacks coincided with organizations struggling to manage
an explosive landscape of vulnerabilities that amplified systemic risk. The constant
disclosure of vulnerabilities affecting legacy infrastructure like Microsoft Active 
Directory continued to burden security teams and present an open door to attackers, 
while the ubiquitous Log4Shell vulnerability ushered in a new era of “vulnerability 
rediscovery,”
during which adversaries modify or reapply the same exploit to target other similarly
vulnerable products. 

Even our wins on the security front were tempered by the adversaries’ ability to adapt.
Collaboration between the government and private sector dramatically improved, resulting
in the arrest and dismantling of some of the world’s most notorious ransomware gangs —
only to see splinter groups recalibrate and flourish. 

Stopping breaches requires an understanding of the adversary, including their
motivations, techniques and how they’re going to target your organization. Developed
based on the firsthand observations of our elite cyber responders and analysts,
CrowdStrike’s annual Global Threat Report provides this actionable intelligence to
protectors around the world. 

Last year, CrowdStrike’s Global Threat Report highlighted that 80% of cyberattacks
leveraged identity-based techniques to compromise legitimate credentials and try to
evade detection. This year, the report shows adversaries are doubling down on stolen
credentials, with a 112% year-over-year increase in advertisements for access-broker
services identified in the criminal underground. Organizations armed with this knowledge
last year were able to harden their defenses and stay a step ahead of the adversary.

The report shows that security must parallel the slope of technology innovation.
As technology matures, security has to mature and match the innovation of the
technology running our organizations. The same thing can be said for the adversary.
With every innovation we achieve, we can expect the adversary to actively seek
ways to exploit it. From the cloud to Kubernetes, from AI to applications and more,
as technology gets more complex and provides tremendous operational gains,
security must evolve to protect the productivity we gain. 

A few critical takeaways of the 2023 Global Threat Report are: 
 - How a new, emerging lass of emerging class of eCrime threat actors is using fileless 
attacks to target high-profile organisation with devastating campaigns
 - Why identity protection continues to be a core requirement for risk mitigation as 
adversaries ramp up attacks on multifactor authentication
 - Why adversaries are accelerating cloud exploitation and the tactics they're using to 
compromose cloud infrastructure
 - How adversaries have created a new "state of the art" for vulnerability exploitation 
to sidestep patches and why the industry needs to demand more security software.

About Crowdstrike:
At CrowdStrike, our mission today is the same as when we started: to stop breaches
so our customers can move forward. Our focus is on delivering the platform, technology
and intelligence needed to keep you ahead of the adversary. This is why we’ve unified
and delivered critical protections like endpoint and extended detection and response
(EDR and XDR), identity threat protection, cloud security, vulnerability and risk
management, threat intelligence and much more — all from a single platform. 

The 2022 Threat Landscape:
The 2022 cyber threat landscape was defined by persistence, increased target
scope and relentless determination. As businesses began to ease pandemic-driven
operating environments and adjust to geopolitical shifts and growing economic
hardships, adversaries supporting nation-state, eCrime and hacktivist motivations 
started
2022 with a relentless show of effort that endured throughout the year.

Nation-state adversaries engaged in relentless computer network operations throughout
2022, emphasizing the integral role these operations play in supporting state goals.
Russian state-nexus adversaries combined destructive, espionage and information
operations (IO) attacks in constant support of the Ukraine war, and China statenexus 
adversaries dominated the cyber threat landscape with a significant increase
in espionage operation volume and target scope. Iran continued to focus on regional
espionage campaigns and their now-signature destructive “lock-and-leak” operations
leveraging ransomware, and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) state-nexus
adversaries persisted in cryptocurrency theft campaigns to supplement state funds in the
wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the nation’s long-standing economic hardship.

Over the course of 2022, eCrime adversaries continued to prove their ability to adapt,
splinter, regroup and flourish in the face of defensive measures. After some of the biggest
and most notorious ransomware enterprise shutdowns, ransomware affiliates moved to new
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations. Additionally, more than 2,500 advertisements
for access were identified across the criminal underground, representing a 112% increase
compared to 2021 and demonstrating a clear demand for access broker services.

CrowdStrike Intelligence also observed an increase in social engineering using human
interaction, such as vishing, to successfully download malware or circumvent multifactor
authentication (MFA), proving direct interaction with victims remains a valuable asset to
eCrime operations.

Hacktivists in 2022 embraced an environment of misinformation, capitalizing on major
geopolitical shifts to relentlessly stoke national unrest and promote specific ideologies.
While much of their activity concentrated on entities within the Russo-Ukrainian region,
increased spillover activity involving targeting of near-abroad, European and U.S. entities
occurred throughout the latter half of 2022 into 2023. 

More than 2,500 advertisements for access were identified across the criminal underground, 
representing a 112% increase compared to 2021 and demonstrating a clear demand for access 
broker services.

While it’s clear adversaries were persistent in pursuit of their goals in 2022, the year
also demonstrated how relentless determination works both ways. CrowdStrike
Intelligence began the year with a flying start, outpacing adversaries throughout
2022 with expansive reporting that captured new developments in real time as well
as identified and tracked new adversaries. 

Over the course of the year, CrowdStrike Intelligence began tracking 33 new adversaries, 
raising the total number of actors tracked to over 200. While most CrowdStrike-tracked 
eCrime emanates from Eastern Europe and Russia, CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to 
name new adversaries operating from different regions, demonstrating the ubiquity of the threat. 
In 2022, CrowdStrike Intelligence introduced its first Syria-nexus adversary, DEADEYE HAWK,
which was formerly tracked as DEADEYE JACKAL. 

CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to expand its threat landscape coverage beyond
targeted intrusion, eCrime, hacktivist, vulnerability intelligence and mobile mission areas. 
In 2022, CrowdStrike Intelligence increased support for cloud intelligence across all products 
and will introduce threat intelligence coverage for industrial control systems in 2023. 

CrowdStrike relentlessly focused on empowering customers by releasing new services
and features throughout 2022. CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence Recon — a tool that
enables customers to uncover potentially malicious criminal underground activity — gained
new features including underground trends reporting, typosquatting detection, complex
historical search functionality and Falcon Intelligence Recon support for managed security
service providers (MSSPs). The year 2022 also saw the launch of CrowdStrike Falcon®
Surface, an external attack-surface management product resulting from CrowdStrike’s
acquisition of Reposify.

Also in 2022, CrowdStrike created a Vulnerability Intelligence module to help customers
quickly identify information associated with vulnerabilities and provide relevant
intelligence reporting to support their understanding of vulnerability context. For further
customer-driven research and analysis, CrowdStrike released the MITRE ATT&CK®
Navigator1 for tracked adversaries, which provides customers with particular actors’
MITRE ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques as well as links to associated MITRE
information and relevant CrowdStrike Intelligence reporting.

The CrowdStrike 2023 Global Threat Report summarizes the entirety of the CrowdStrike
Intelligence team’s analysis performed throughout a relentless 2022, including
descriptions of notable themes, trends and events across the cyber threat landscape.
This report also includes anticipatory threat assessments to help prepare and protect
organizations through the coming year. 

Threat Landscape Overview:
The CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatch™ team measures breakout time — the
time an adversary takes to move laterally, from an initially compromised host
to another host within the victim environment. The average breakout time for
interactive eCrime intrusion activity declined from 98 minutes in 2021 to 84
minutes in 2022.

By responding within the breakout time window, defenders can minimize the
costs and other damages caused by attackers. Security teams are encouraged
to meet the 1-10-60 rule: detecting threats within the first minute, understanding
the threats within 10 minutes and responding within 60 minutes. 

	Access Brokers
Access brokers are threat actors who acquire access to organizations and provide or sell 
this access to other actors, including ransomware operators. The popularity of their services 
increased in 2022, with more than 2,500 advertisements for access identified — a 112% increase 
compared to 2021.

Several brokers advertised accesses in bulk during 2022, while others continued to use the 
“one-access one-auction” technique. Access methods used by brokers have remained relatively 
consistent since 2021; a particularly popular tactic involves abusing compromised credentials 
that were acquired via information stealers or purchased in log shops on the
criminal underground.

	Beyond Malware
There was a continued shift away from malware use, with malware-free activity accounting for 
71% of all detections in 2022 (up from 62% in 2021). This was partly related to adversaries’ 
prolific abuse of valid credentials to facilitate access and persistence in victim environments. 
Another contributing factor was the rate at which new vulnerabilities were disclosed and the speed 
with which adversaries were able to operationalize exploits.

	Interactive Intrusions
Compared to 2021, CrowdStrike observed a 50% increase in the number of interactive intrusion 
campaigns with accelerating activity into the fourth quarter. In addition, the technology sector was 
the most frequently targeted vertical in which Falcon OverWatch uncovered interactive intrusion 
activity in 2022. 
This reflects an increase compared with the relative frequency of intrusions in the top 10 industry 
verticals from the prior 12 months.

2022 Themes:
	eCrime actors gained notoriety for high-profile attacks 
eCrime actors constantly search for new ways to increase revenue, and they often seek out novel 
techniques or tools to expand their target reach or impact. Over the course of 2022, CrowdStrike 
Intelligence observed two newly named adversaries — SLIPPY SPIDER and SCATTERED SPIDER — pushing 
operational limits by targeting high-profile victims and impacting associated employees, customers
 and partners. 

Adversaries must possess high skill levels and significantresources in order to thwart takedowns, 
arrests and potential extradition while sustaining operations against multinational and global entities. 
SLIPPY SPIDER and SCATTERED SPIDER have both successfully used a variety of techniques including 
MFA fatigue, vishing and SIM swapping.

	Slippy Spider
In 2022, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a 20% increase in the number of adversaries conducting 
data theft and extortion campaigns without deploying ransomware. Ransomware adversaries seeking to 
exert additional pressure on victims have commonly leaked victim data as a leverage tactic since 2019; 
CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed this “double extortion” model as the most common tactic exhibited 
by tracked big game hunting (BGH) adversaries. For many organizations, the threat of a data leak — which 
may impact sensitive proprietary data as well as customers’ and employees’ personally identifiable 
information (PII) — can prove as compelling an incentive to pay a ransom as the disruption caused by ransomware.

In February and March 2022, SLIPPY SPIDER attracted significant attention in thesecurity community 
for a series of high-profile data theft and extortion incidents 
targeting technology companies including Microsoft, Nvidia, Okta and Samsung. 
The adversary used their public Telegram channels to leak data including victim source code, employee credentials and PII. 
Although SLIPPY SPIDER made large ransom demands in exchange for not leaking the stolen data, CrowdStrike Intelligence has 
no evidence to suggest any of those demands were met. This targeting of high-profile victims and the large volume of stolen 
and leaked data drew the focus of various law
enforcement operations in mid-2022.

Once they had the attention of law enforcement, SLIPPY SPIDER was likely not sufficiently skilled or resourced 
to sustain their targeting and ultimately recover their operations. 
CrowdStrike Intelligence has not observed SLIPPY SPIDER activity since June 2022.

	Scattered Spider
Since at least March 2022, SCATTERED SPIDER has conducted targeted social engineering campaigns 
primarily against firms specializing in customer relationship management and business process outsourcing. 
The adversary primarily uses phishing pages to capture authentication credentials for Okta, VPNs or edge devices, 
and socially engineers users to share one-time password multifactor authentication (MFA) codes or overwhelms 
them using MFA notification fatigue.

After achieving initial access, SCATTERED SPIDER deploys a vast array of legitimate remote monitoring and management 
tools or utilities such as PuTTY to maintain persistent access. In one case, the adversary demonstrated fluency with 
lateral movement and credential access across cloud-provider environments, including harvesting credentials using 
instance metadata service. To evade detection, the adversary has employed several different tools to bypass or 
terminate endpoint security software.

SCATTERED SPIDER leverages access to technology companies to target thirdparty companies, such as victims’ customers, 
with a heavy focus on accessing cellular service providers. While SCATTERED SPIDER’s operational goal is not entirely known, 
the adversary has been observed swapping SIMs using access to cellular service providers. The adversary’s SIM swapping likely 
enables follow-on third-party compromise. In some cases, the adversary has also captured individual user account data for resale, 
or targeted data relating to cryptocurrency companies. SCATTERED SPIDER has gained attention due to the high-profile nature of their victims.

The continued rise of cloud exploitation:
The CrowdStrike 2022 Global Threat Report predicted that cloud exploitation would increase as more businesses 
moved operations to cloud environments and more adversaries became “cloud-conscious” — a term referring to 
threat actors aware of the ability to compromise cloud workloads and who use this knowledge to abuse features 
unique to the cloud for their own purposes. 

Over the course of 2022, cloud exploitation increased as expected: Observed cloud exploitation cases grew by 95%, 
and cases involving cloud-conscious actors nearly tripled from 2021. This growth indicates a larger trend of eCrime 
and nation-state actors adopting knowledge and tradecraft to increasingly exploit cloud environments.

As cloud integration continues to increase across business environments, adversaries are
adding the cloud to their targeting aperture to expand the impact of their attacks. Though
the goals of adversaries’ operations often remain identical or similar to their intrusion
ambitions outside cloud environments — i.e., gain initial access, gain persistence and move
laterally — the short-lived nature of some cloud environments means adversaries may need
a more tenacious approach to succeed. CrowdStrike Intelligence expects cloud-conscious
targeting to continue into 2023. This assessment is made with high confidence based on
the three-fold increase in this targeting observed in 2022 as well as the ever-increasing
need for entities to integrate the cloud into the daily working environment. 

	Top cloud-conscious TTPs of 2022
Throughout 2022, cloud-conscious actors deployed a variety of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to exploit cloud environments. 
CrowdStrike Intelligence observed actors continuing to rely on valid cloud accounts but also increasingly looking to publicfacing 
applications for initial access. More actors were seen moving toward cloud account discovery, compared to the heavier reliance on cloud 
infrastructure discovery observed in 2021. Actors were also identified using valid higher-privileged accounts for privilege escalation in 2022. 
Notably, in terms of defense evasion tactics, CrowdStrike Intelligence saw actors shift away from the deactivation of antivirus and firewall 
technologies, as well as from log-tampering efforts. Instead, they were observed seeking ways to modify authentication processes and attack identities. 

Tactics supporting data access also began moving toward exfiltration from information repositories as well as cloud storage and local systems. 
Finally, in addition to previously reported resource-hijacking impacts, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed actors incorporating destructive actions 
such as account access removal, data destruction, resource deletion and service stoppage.

		Initial Access
Throughout 2022, cloud-conscious actors primarily obtained initial access to the cloud
by using existing, valid accounts, resetting passwords or placing webshells or reverse
shells for persistence after exploiting public-facing applications such as web servers.

Once on a machine, actors attempted to gain access primarily through credentials found
in files, but also via the cloud provider's instance metadata services (IMDSs).

Since workloads in the cloud are very dynamic and potentially short-lived, most actors
established persistence with valid cloud accounts they already possessed or for which
they were able to reset the password. Alternatively, if the actor obtained initial access
via a web server, they placed webshells or reverse shells on the compromised
machine for persistence.

		Discovery
During initial environment discovery, actors primarily focused on cloud accounts — for
persistence and potential privilege escalation — as well as reachable network services,
but also searched for cloud permission groups, infrastructure and storage buckets.

		Lateral Movement
To move laterally inside a cloud environment, actors used protocols such as RDP, SSH and
SMB; actors with console access also leveraged services such as EC2 instance connect
and the Systems Manager Session Manager to achieve this goal.

		Privilege Escalation
Actors escalated their privileges by gaining access to accounts with higher privileges,
either by finding credentials for these accounts or resetting credentials that already existed.

		Defense Evasion
Actors tried to evade defenses by deactivating security products running inside virtual
machines. Other actors attempted to masquerade by choosing proxy exits close to
expected victim locations or naming newly created virtual machines according to
victims' naming scheme.

		Data Collection
To collect data, actors turned to local systems as well as internal information repositories
such as code repositories, SharePoint, internal tooling and databases.

		Impact

Despite industry reports claiming resource hijacking was the most common impact
technique used in 2022, the most ubiquitous impact technique was actually destructive,
with actors removing access to accounts, terminating services, destroying data and
deleting resources.

	Suspected Panda becoming more cloud-conscious
Successful exploitation of CVE-2022-29464 enables remote code execution and
unrestricted file uploads. On the same day the vulnerability affecting multiple WSO2
products was disclosed, exploit code was made publicly available. Adversaries were
quick to capitalize on the opportunity. Falcon OverWatch threat hunters began identifying
multiple exploitation incidents in which adversaries used tools, infrastructure and TTPs
consistent with China-nexus activity. There is increasing evidence that adversaries are
growing more confident leveraging traditional endpoints to pivot to cloud infrastructure.
The reverse is also true: Cloud infrastructure is being used as a gateway to traditional
endpoints. Figure 2 shows three of the ways Falcon OverWatch has observed
adversaries make this pivot in interactive intrusions.

The 2022 vulnerability intelligence landscape:
CrowdStrike Intelligence saw actors consistently focus on previously established
attack vectors and components to achieve exploitation in 2022. There are two ways
adversaries can pursue this approach to exploit development following vulnerability
discovery. The actors can modify — or even reapply — the same exploit to target other
similarly vulnerable products. 

Alternatively, the discovery process can identify a potential
target and encourage actors to focus on these known vulnerable components, as well as
circumvent patching by exploring other exploit vectors (see Figure 3). This is particularly
true for edge devices, which are often vulnerable to various injection techniques and
arbitrary file-delivery exploits.

	Vulnerability discovery and rediscovery:
The notorious and prolonged nature of Log4Shell exploitation was the most prominent
example of vulnerability discovery across numerous products in 2022. Log4Shell
exploitation was initially opportunistic in nature, with actors seeking vulnerable products
and targeting what they could find. However, variations of the exploit targeting other fields, leveraging other protocols and using obfuscation techniques rapidly allowed for tailored CVE-2021-44228 exploitation in other products where exploitation was not initially
achievable. Falcon Intelligence Recon observed continued CVE-2021-44228 discussions
among threat actors in the criminal underground during 2022, reflecting sustained
interest in Log4Shell exploitation (see Figure 4).

Starting in January 2022, a similar discovery and exploitation process across myriad
products unfolded in the context of the PwnKit exploit, which targeted the Polkit package
most Linux platforms use to manage permissions using privilege escalation vulnerability
CVE-2021-4034. While open-source projects are more likely to be impacted by
vulnerability exploitation issues, integrating vulnerable packages from external sources
also routinely contributed to proprietary software exploitation throughout 2022.

	Circumvention of earlier patches:
The disclosure of a vulnerability, particularly one acknowledged as previously exploited
in the wild, highlights potentially viable mechanisms for future exploitation. Zero-day and
N-day vulnerabilities observed in 2022 demonstrated threat actors’ ability to leverage
specialized knowledge to circumvent mitigations from previous patches to target the
same vulnerable components.

For example, the proxy mechanisms exploited to compromise Microsoft Exchange during
ProxyLogon and ProxyShell campaigns in 2021 were targeted again in Q4 2022, this time
using an authenticated variation called ProxyNotShell (CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-
41082). ProxyNotShell mitigations were subsequently bypassed when ransomwareaffiliated actors used an alternative exploitation vector that abused CVE-2022-41080 to
accomplish the same objectives.

A similar pattern emerged among a series of zero-day exploits associated with the
Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver observed between March and August
2022. Demonstrating their expertise, developers of the CVE-2022-37969 exploit
employed a technique to identify and bypass mitigations intended for an earlier CLFS
vulnerability (CVE-2022-24521).

Zero-day and N-day vulnerabilities observed in 2022 demonstrated threat actors’ ability to
leverage specialized knowledge to circumvent mitigations from previous patches to target the same vulnerable components.


Russian Cyber Operations are supporting the war in Ukraine:
The Russia-Ukraine war that began in 2022 has involved unprecedented use of cyber
capabilities sustained throughout the extended ongoing military campaign.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed a spectrum of Russia-nexus activity relating to
this conflict, including extensive intelligence collection activities, information operationsaiming to influence public sentiment and the deployment of destructive attacks against government and commercial networks. These operations, set against a backdrop of
wide-ranging patriotic hacktivism aligned with Russian aims, often targeted Western
entities that Russian state-nexus adversaries currently seem unwilling to pursue.

While the Kremlin integrated cyber capabilities into its military campaigns well before
2022 — typically involving distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks — its 2022
activity demonstrates the extent to which Russia will use a wide variety of tools to achieve
its aims, with varying levels of success. Figure 5 depicts a high-level overview of how
Russia-nexus operational activity levels changed throughout 2022, categorized across
intelligence collection, IO and destructive motivations. 

CrowdStrike Intelligence identified Ukrainian entity targeting in operations associated
with various Russia state-nexus, Russia-aligned or likely Russia-origin adversaries
throughout 2022. Consistent with Russia’s military focus, the Main Intelligence
Directorate (GRU) seems to bear responsibility for many of the operations against
Ukraine, although the Federal Security Service (FSB) has also supported the war effort
through intelligence-collection activities. 

Adversaries such as FANCY BEAR, EMBER BEAR, VOODOO BEAR, PRIMITIVE
BEAR and GOSSAMER BEAR — as well as the RepeatingUmbra and LostPotential
activity clusters — were particularly active against Ukraine in 2022. Other unattributed
campaigns also targeted organizations and individuals in Ukraine, likely for intelligencegathering purposes. These typically employed credential phishing methodologies to gain access to their targets’ email accounts. 

On January 14, 2022, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a steady stream of intelligence
collection activity performed against Ukrainian targets was supplemented by a series of
disruptive and destructive EMBER BEAR operations that included website defacements
and WhisperGate wiper malware deployments. This campaign was highly likely intended
to degrade the Ukrainian government’s ability to operate as well as psychologically impact
Ukrainian citizens with the suggestion that Ukrainian authorities could not protect them
from the ensuing military campaign. 

Psychological operations escalated during February 2022, with multiple DDoS attacks
against Ukrainian government portals and financial institutions that likely aimed to exert
pressure on Ukrainian citizens by disrupting their ability to conduct routine activities such as accessing banking services. Western government sources later attributed some of
these attacks to the GRU.

Adversaries such as FANCY BEAR, EMBER BEAR, VOODOO BEAR, PRIMITIVE BEAR and GOSSAMER BEAR — as well as the RepeatingUmbra and LostPotential activity clusters — have been particularly active against Ukraine this year.

	Ember Bear - The public face of destructive operations in Ukraine
Many destructive Russian operations conducted against Ukrainian networks since the invasion began have been covertly run in efforts to deny Ukrainian citizens access to a specific resource — such as energy supply or a government database — without evoking public awareness.

In contrast, destructive EMBER BEAR operations between January and February 2022 were conducted openly, defacing government websites toannounce data destruction and public information leaks under the pretense of hacktivism to mislead attribution.

This novel approach to destructive operations indicates EMBER BEAR will likely operate in limited situations in which psychological impact is of particular importance.

On February 23, 2022, Russia-nexus adversaries began launching multiple assaults on
Ukrainian network infrastructure using an unparalleled quantity of unique destructive
malware families as well as continued website defacements. Within 48 hours, new wiper
malware families DriveSlayer, PartyTicket, IsaacWiper and AcidRain were deployed against
target networks, coinciding with the advent of Russia’s military invasion in the early hours
of February 24, 2022. The use of AcidRain — deployed less than one hour after Russian
President Vladimir Putin’s “special military operation” announcement — was particularly
notable, as it appeared specifically designed to disrupt Viasat satellite communications
network segments providing network connectivity to Ukraine. 

While the true impact of this early action against Ukrainian government and military
communications remains unclear, it was felt beyond its borders. At least three internet
service providers across Europe were also affected by this disruption, resulting in outages
for thousands of customers and the disruption of wind turbine network communications
in parts of Germany.

After an initial surge of activity in the first week of the war, Russia-nexus offensive cyber operations continued at a highly elevated pace, although with a marked reduction in
capability and tooling variety. For example, the DoubleZero wiper was first deployed
in mid-March 2022 but did not exhibit sophistication comparable to other destructive
malware deployed in Ukraine. This shift in quality suggests operations became more
tactical and opportunistic at this time, likely reflecting a lack of planning beyond the
Kremlin’s expectations of a short military conflict period.

Russian cyber activity during the second half of 2022 was largely characterized by a shift in focus to intelligencecollection operations, likely indicating increasing Russian military and Kremlin requirements for situational awareness as their advances into Ukraine stalled and reversed.

Activity attributed to VOODOO BEAR was the exception to this reduction in operational
activity. This included CaddyWiper deployments that began on March 14, 2022, and
continued throughout the year, as well as attacks against the Ukrainian energy sector
using a new CrashOverride variant and a range of scripts designed to wipe Linux and
Solaris systems. These operations were highly likely more complex — though arguably
with little wide-ranging effect — and therefore required longer staging and execution
periods, illustrating the complexity of effectively leveraging cyber operations compared to
well-established kinetic military doctrine.

Russian cyber activity during the second half of 2022 was largely characterized by a shift
in focus to intelligence-collection operations, likely indicating increasing Russian military and Kremlin requirements for situational awareness as their advances into Ukraine stalled and reversed. Identified campaigns have included extensive efforts by FANCY BEAR,
PRIMITIVE BEAR and activity clusters RepeatingUmbra and LostPotential to conduct
spear-phishing and credential-phishing operations against Ukrainian targets. 

GOSSAMER BEAR credential phishing operations have also maintained a high
operational tempo since February 2022, including the targeting of government research
labs, military suppliers, logistics companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
from August 2022 onward. This focused targeting likely indicates this adversary’s
ambitions to gather intelligence related to Western military support to Ukraine, although
the targeting of NGOs could also represent the preparation of information operations
against organizations that may be involved in impending Russian war crime investigations. 

Despite a greater emphasis on intelligence collection activity, likely Russia-nexus
destructive malware families Prestige and RansomBoggs — disguised as ransomware —
were deployed in October and November 2022. Historically, VOODOO BEAR has
extensively masqueraded their wiping intents with pseudo-ransomware threats —
however, their most recent wiper deployments did not use this deceit, likely due to the
limited benefit of obscuring attribution against Ukrainian targets. Russia’s recent return
to using fake ransomware suggests its intent to widen its targeting to include sectors
and regions in which destructive operations are considered politically risky.

At present, the overall impact of Russia’s cyber operations within the context of the
2022 Ukraine invasion is unclear. While Russia’s cyber capabilities have undoubtedly
contributed to Russia’s military campaign, they have also demonstrated inherent
wartime limitations. This is particularly true in the case of destructive attacks, which
frequently require extensive planning but are often less effective and enduring
when compared to their kinetic counterparts. In addition to the effects of significant
assistance Ukraine received from the international community, Russia’s operational
efficacy was also likely reduced due to Ukraine’s improved defensive capabilities since
Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014.

These factors have potentially influenced the course of Russian military strategy in
this conflict, diverging from public expectations of how cyber operations can support
modern warfare. Attacks against core sectors such as energy, telecommunications,
transportation and media have not been as extensive as predicted, likely indicating the
Kremlin expected a swift and decisive victory over Ukraine and planned to use these
functioning resources to keep Ukraine running under a new regime.

Early concerns regarding significant collateral damage to international networks have
also not been fully realized. Identified attacks have mostly been localized to Ukrainian
networks and have avoided using uncontrolled propagation mechanisms that might
spread across unintended sectors and regions. Despite this, currently unaffected
sectors may experience future targeting as the war progresses and potentially
changes course.

China-Nexus adversaries significantly increased 2022 operational scale:
CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks and identifies China-nexus adversaries as the most
active targeted intrusion groups. In 2022, China-nexus adversaries — as well as actors
using TTPs consistent with China-nexus adversaries — were observed targeting nearly
all 39 global industry sectors and 20 geographic regions CrowdStrike Intelligence
tracks. These intrusions were likely intended to collect strategic intelligence,
compromise intellectual property and further the surveillance of targeted groups, all of
which are key Chinese Communist Party (CCP) intelligence goals.

Throughout 2022, China-nexus adversaries primarily targeted organizations based in
East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia and South Asia that operated in the government,
technology and telecommunications sectors. Intrusions in these regions accounted for
roughly two-thirds of the China-nexus targeted intrusion activity CrowdStrike Intelligence
confirmed in 2022. European and North American targeting accounted for approximately
one-fourth of China-nexus intrusion activity; activity targeting Africa, South America and
Oceania comprised the remainder.

Government-sector targeting across countries neighboring China almost certainly
represents a standing intelligence collection mission for China-nexus adversaries.
Telecommunications and technology sector organizations in these regions remain
high-priority targets for China-nexus adversaries, albeit for distinctly separate motives.
Technology entities face ongoing economic espionage campaigns targeting research
and development data, proprietary information and trade secrets. Telecommunications
entities present adversaries with the capacity to amplify intelligence collection or
surveillance efforts via direct access to foreign telecommunications infrastructure.

China-nexus adversaries were observed targeting nearly all 39 global industry sectors and 20
geographic regions CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks.

	Taiwan is a target region for Chinese (Panda) adversaries
CrowdStrike Intelligence observed China-nexus adversaries overwhelmingly target Taiwan-based technology organizations during 2022, which is consistent with the likely economic espionage mission associated with China-nexus actors in support of CCP goals for technologic independence and dominance. These operations may also support the CCP’s desire for cross-strait unification with Taiwan through governmental or military means. Despite inflammatory antiWestern rhetoric and subsequent large-scale Chinese military drills in the Taiwan
Strait in response to a high-level state visit in mid-2022 by U.S. Speaker of the
House Nancy Pelosi, CrowdStrike Intelligence did not observe an increase in Taiwan-focused China-nexus targeting activity. However, CrowdStrike Intelligence did observe a direct increase in Chinese-affiliated nationalist hacktivist activity targeting Taiwanese organizations with web defacements and DDoS attacks during this time frame.

CrowdStrike Intelligence observed Chinanexus adversaries overwhelmingly target Taiwan-based technology organizations during 2022, which is consistent with the likely economic espionage
mission associated with China-nexus actors in support of CCP goals for technologic independence and dominance.

	China-nexus adversaries continued shifting toward exploitation of web-facing services:
In 2022, CrowdStrike Intelligence continued to observe multiple instances in which
China-nexus adversaries utilized exploits for web-facing services to gain initial access to
targeted organizations. This included the use of zero-day exploits and rapid adoption of
publicly released exploits.

Zero-day exploits were most commonly observed in intrusions targeting North American
organizations in 2022; China-nexus adversaries used zero-day exploits to compromise
entities in the aerospace, legal and academic sectors. Additional zero-day exploits
delivered using weaponized Microsoft Office documents were observed likely targeting
the Philippines defense sector, Nepalese telecommunications sector and Russian
government sectors; these are also suspected to have targeted groups associated with
Tibetan independence movements. 

Enterprise software continued to be a high-priority target for China-nexus adversaries
in 2022. In this time frame, China-nexus adversaries identified and exploited zero-day
vulnerabilities in the following products: CITRIX ADC and Citrix Gateway (CVE-2022-
27518), Microsoft Exchange Server and the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (CVE2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082), and Atlassian Confluence Server and Confluence
Data Center (CVE-2022-26134).

Throughout 2022, China-nexus adversaries continued to rapidly adopt and exploit
vulnerabilities in enterprise software following public disclosure and release of proofof-concept (POC) code. CrowdStrike Intelligence identified China-nexus adversaries
targeting known vulnerabilities in multiple products including Zoho ManageEngine
Password Manager Pro (CVE-2022-35405), VMware vCenter Server (CVE-2021-22005),
WSO2 (CVE-2022-29464), Polkit pkexec (CVE-2021-4034), F5 Big IP devices (CVE2022-1388) and Apache Log4J (CVE-2021-44228). Falcon OverWatch and CrowdStrike
Intelligence also observed multiple instances of suspected but unconfirmed China-nexus
adversary vulnerabilities exploitation on web-facing services throughout 2022.

China-nexus groups with varying levels of sophistication increasingly targeting zero-day
and publicly available vulnerabilities in web-facing services for initial access represents
a meaningful tactical shift. Initial access techniques historically associated with Chinanexus adversaries — including spear-phishing, credential harvesting and strategic web
compromises (SWC) — were identified as less frequently used in 2022 when compared
to the widespread reliance on exploitation of external-facing vulnerabilities. While
adversaries still use these earlier techniques, their prevalence is likely to continue to
wane as China-nexus actors gain familiarity with the exploitation of remote services and
improve backend processes to provide operators with zero-day and POC exploits to
target organizations worldwide.


Crowdstrike eCrime index:
The CrowdStrike® eCrime Index (ECX) tracks activity across multiple segments of the
eCrime ecosystem, including botnet and spam activity, and calculates the total number
of observed ransomware victims. Overall, the 2022 ECX exhibited trends similar to those
observed in 2021 (Figure 7), with a peak occurring across March and April 2022. 

One of the most prominent factors that likely affected the ECX during this peak was
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Several eCrime actors increased activity at this time,
including SALTY SPIDER and SCULLY SPIDER, which launched DDoS attacks, and other
eCrime actors that used the invasion as a theme for social engineering lures. Additionally,
CrowdStrike Intelligence identified a significant increase in access broker activity across
2022, with HERMIT SPIDER’s PrivateLoader distributing more than 900 unique payloads
at its peak in March 2022.

Another significant fluctuation was observed in 2022, this time in September, potentially
attributed to increases in corporate access advertisements and BGH victims published
to dedicated leak sites. Other prominent events in September 2022 included a new
MALLARD SPIDER QakBot version release, frequent Shindig activity and the BITWISE
SPIDER LockBit 3.0 leak.

Despite these increases, the overall ECX value in 2022 was lower than in 2021. Two major
eCrime adversaries suffered hits to their daily operations: WIZARD SPIDER closed their
Conti RaaS following a series of damaging leaks, and HERMIT SPIDER ceased their
PrivateLoader operations, significantly impacting ECX factors such as BGH victims and
malware distribution throughout the remainder of 2022.

CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses these setbacks are only temporary and ECX values will
likely return to 2021 values or higher during 2023. This assessment is made with moderate
confidence, as BGH and enabling adversaries such as COMPASS SPIDER, LILY SPIDER,
BRAIN SPIDER and Black Basta continue to emerge. Established adversaries such as
BITWISE SPIDER, ALPHA SPIDER and MALLARD SPIDER continue to make significant
malware maintenance efforts. Additionally, despite losing affiliates, WIZARD SPIDER’s core
members have remained active and will likely return in some capacity. Lastly, adversaries
continue to adjust their TTPs — for example, BGH operations increased data extortion
intrusions without using ransomware — which may affect the ECX in 2023.

BITWISE SPIDER’s LockBit RaaS remained the most prolific BGH operation in 2022 — the adversary’s affiliates posted more than 800 victim organizations to the LockBit DLS in 2022.

Conclusion of the 2023 Global Threat Report:
In 2022, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed adversaries across the targeted intrusion,
eCrime and hacktivist landscapes operating with relentless determination to meet
their goals. These adversaries continued to seek novel ways to bypass security
measures to conduct successful initial infections, impede analysis by researchers
and refine tried-and-tested techniques. 

eCrime adversaries have continued to operate at a phenomenal rate, which is expected to
continue in 2023. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses BGH will remain the dominant threat
in the eCrime landscape and continue shifting to the use of RaaS networks, with affiliates
moving from one to another to ensure continued success and increased criminal revenue.
It’s also expected BGH will continue to pursue data theft and extortion without the use
of ransomware. Further, it’s likely that as activity from access brokers continues to grow
and gain attention, the individuals behind these initial access operations may choose to
conceal the details of the victims — making it harder to assess who could be at risk — and
become dedicated brokers to RaaS partnerships. 

As global enterprises make changes to thwart eCrime operators, adversaries will likely
extend their reach using novel techniques such as increased social engineering and
direct engagement with the victim, as seen in 2022. The threat to the increasingly popular
cryptocurrency market will continue, with operational tempo likely fluctuating in line with
cryptocurrency values. Formjacking will continue as a credible threat, allowing eCrime
actors to steal, sell and/or make use of victim PII. 

Most targeted intrusion activity identified in 2022 was driven by traditional espionage
motivations, despite the window into what cyber operations can look like during wartime,
provided by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This reflects a broader reality: As a tool of state power, malicious cyber activity remains most effective in roles traditionally associatedwith intelligence operations, including niche efforts such as deniable disruption,
information operations and currency generation. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that
targeted intrusion adversaries will continue to predominantly present data theft threats to
the vast majority of sectors and geographies in 2023. 

However, Russian and Iranian state-nexus adversaries will continue to present outsized threats of disruptive or destructive activity in connection to geopolitical developments, while North Korean adversaries will remain the state-nexus threat in relation to currency theft. The scale and scope of China-nexus targeted intrusion activity is unlikely to contract in 2023, as cyber espionage remains a critical instrument to support the CCP’s strategic and economic ambitions.

Big game hunting will very likely remain the primary eCrime threat to organizations across the majority of geographical regions and industry sectors in 2023.

Hacktivism will continue to support a variety of political ideals, particularly in countries
experiencing civil unrest or war. As demonstrated by the surge of hacktivism from both
sides of Russia’s war in Ukraine, such activity increasingly presents a likelihood that third parties associated with, but not necessarily directly engaged in, a conflict will be targeted by nationalist hacktivist adversaries. While that war will likely continue to be the key topic of hacktivism in 2023, other such activity — likely opportunistic in nature and almost certainly associated with specific geopolitical events — is anticipated to continue at levels roughly equivalent to those seen in 2022.

For the vulnerability threat landscape, CrowdStrike Intelligence anticipates many of
the techniques observed in 2022 will remain relevant throughout 2023, as specialized
knowledge enabling these exploits is transferable and can be applied to lower the
marginal cost of discovery. 

Mobile-based social engineering techniques in intrusion attempts will also likely increase
in the coming year, particularly with the publicity and success of adversaries such as
SCATTERED SPIDER potentially enticing other threat actors to try similar TTPs.

In response to these relentless threats, CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to provide
industry-leading adversary tracking, unparalleled malware analysis, geopolitical trends
and shifts, and real-time campaign trend analysis through its suite of reporting products
and coverage of threat landscapes spanning targeted intrusion, eCrime, hacktivist,
vulnerability, mobile and cloud threat intelligence so that customers can stay informed
and ensure they are one step ahead of the adversary in 2023.

Five steps to be prepared:
	1. Gain visibility into your security gaps
An organization is only secure if every asset is protected. It’s impossible to protect what
you don’t know about. As adversaries continue to weaponize and target vulnerabilities,
security teams should prioritize visibility and enforcing of IT hygiene across the entire
enterprise asset inventory. The CrowdStrike Falcon platform delivers deep visibility and
protection of your assets (endpoints, identities, cloud, data) so you can catalog your
assets, understand their risk level and ensure they’re protected.

With the advent of accelerated cloud migration, enterprises have expanded their digital
footprint and their attack surface, introducing a tsunami of unknown exposed assets.
External attack surface monitoring (EASM) solutions provide an outside-in view of the
enterprise, enabling organizations to identify areas of exposure and close security gaps.


	2. Prioritise identity protection
The increase in malware-free attacks, social engineering and similar attempts to obtain
access/credentials has made it clear that a traditional endpoint-only solution is not
enough. Integrated identity protection with tight correlation across endpoints, identity
and data is essential. Conditional risk-based access policies are required to reduce MFA
burden and fatigue for legitimate users. CISA’s Shields Up initiative specifically urges
organizations to enforce MFA, as well as to identify and quickly assess unexpected or
unusual network behavior. Find solutions that not only help organizations extend MFA
into legacy and unmanaged systems — both of which are prone to attacks — but also
provide immediate detection and real-time prevention of lateral movement, suspicious
behavior, misuse of service accounts and more.

	3. Prioritse cloud protection
Adversaries are aggressively targeting cloud infrastructure. The number of observed
cloud exploitation cases grew by 95% year-over-year in 2022, and adversaries are using
a broad array of TTPs (e.g., misconfigurations, credential theft, etc.) to compromise
critical business data and applications in the cloud. Stopping cloud breaches requires
agentless capabilities to protect against misconfiguration, control plane and identitybased attacks, combined with runtime security that protects cloud workloads.

	4. Know your adversary
A cyberattack, by definition, is a conflict between two parties. Not knowing or
understanding your adversary when you enter a battle is equal to being unprepared.
Organizations spend years and millions of dollars fighting ghosts and noisy alerts, never
knowing the “who, why and how” behind the attacks. Invest in threat intelligence that
goes beyond supplying IOCs, and ensure it also exposes the humans behind the attack,
as well as their motivation, capabilities and tools. Security teams can use this knowledge
to focus defenses on what matters most: pivoting to action.

Do you know your adversaries? Check out the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe to learn
more about the actors dominating today’s threat landscape and learn which are most
likely to target your organization.

	5. Practice makes perfect
While technology is clearly critical in the fight to detect and stop intrusions, security
teams are the crucial link in the chain to stop breaches. For security teams, practice
makes perfect. Encourage an environment that routinely performs tabletop exercises
and red/blue teaming to identify gaps and eliminate weaknesses in your cybersecurity
practices and response. And security teams shouldn’t be the only ones practicing —
initiate user-awareness programs to combat the continued threat of phishing and related
social engineering techniques.

Crowdstrike eBook - How Crowdstrike aligns with the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Essential Eight Maturity Model <

The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has developed
prioritised mitigation strategies, in the form of the Strategies to Mitigate
Cyber Security Incidents, to help organisations protect themselves
against various cyber threats. The most effective of these mitigation
strategies is the Essential Eight.

The Essential Eight has been designed to protect Microsoft Windows-based
internet-connected networks. While the principles behind the Essential
Eight may be applied to cloud services and enterprise mobility, or to
other operating systems, it was not primarily designed for such purposes
and alternative mitigation strategies may be more appropriate to
mitigate unique cyber threats to these environments. In such cases, the
CrowdStrike controls listed in this document also apply beyond Windows
environments.

The Essential Eight Maturity Model, first published in June 2017 and
updated regularly, supports the implementation of the Essential Eight. It
is based on the ACSC’s experience in producing cyber threat intelligence,
responding to cybersecurity incidents, conducting penetration testing and
assisting organisations to implement the Essential Eight. 

This document shows how CrowdStrike and CrowdStrike Store
partners align to Maturity Level Two of the Essential Eight
Assessment Process Guide for each of the eight mitigation
strategies. As organisations progress through the Maturity levels,
the capabilities described in this document may also be applicable
in addressing the Control Description Test IDs. For more information
on how you can configure CrowdStrike Falcon® in line with the Test
Methodology, please engage your Account Team who can provide a
step-by-step process.

Application Control - Mitigation Strategy. Maturity Level Two:
ML2-AC-01 - (Workstations & Internetfacing servers) A dedicated application
control solution is implemented.
ML2-AC-02 - (Workstations & Internetfacing servers) The system is only able
to execute approved executables.
ML2-AC-03 - (Workstations & Internetfacing servers) The system is only able
to execute approved software libraries.
ML2-AC-04 - (Workstations & Internetfacing servers) The system is only able
to execute approved scripts.
ML2-AC-05 - (Workstations & Internetfacing servers) The system is only able
to execute approved installers.
ML2-AC-06 - (Workstations & Internetfacing servers) The system is only able
to execute approved compiled HTML
files.
ML2-AC-07 - (Workstations & Internetfacing servers) The system is only able
to execute approved HTML applications.
ML2-AC-08 - (Workstations & Internetfacing servers) The system is only able
to execute approved control panel
applets.
ML2-AC-09 - (Workstations & Internetfacing servers) The system is logging
the application control product when it
allows and blocks execution.

The rise of fileless attacks, which are carried out entirely in memory, is
making it hard for traditional security solutions to detect them. In 2022,
71% of all attacks were malware-free.1
The method of protection against fileless attacks through application
control lists all trusted processes to block unknown ones from
executing. However, fileless attacks exploit vulnerabilities in legitimate,
allowlisted apps or use OS executables, making it impossible to block
essential apps for both users and the OS.
XSL script processing is described in the MITRE ATT&CK® framework
under ID T1220. Attackers may bypass application control and achieve
execution of code by embedding scripts within XSL files. These files
contain code that performs formatting on XML files, which means
that it can be a way to run code supplied by an attacker. Due to its
legitimate functionality, attackers can use XSL to bypass application
allowlisting and execute arbitrary code.
Wmic.exe is a command-line utility that comes pre-installed on all
versions of Windows and is used to access Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI). An attacker can use the Wmic.exe to invoke
the code from an XML file. According to MITRE’s ID T1220, an attacker
can also use WMI to perform code execution by using the /FORMAT
switch. It’s also worth noting that Wmic.exe is capable of running code
from local or remote XSL files.
As you can see, fileless techniques are extremely challenging to
detect if you rely on signature-based methods, sandboxing, application
control or even machine learning protection methods.

CrowdStrike uses a unique approach to application control as part of its
endpoint protection solution. This approach combines multiple methods
such as machine learning, custom rules, memory protection and file integrity
monitoring. By using these complementary methods, CrowdStrike provides
a powerful and integrated approach that delivers unrivaled endpoint
protection against fileless attacks and other cyber threats:
∎ CrowdStrike Falcon® Prevent (NGAV): CrowdStrike combines human
and machine intelligence to uncover new threats and enable high-fidelity
detections. Machine learning is implemented across the process lifecycle
in the CrowdStrike Falcon platform. In this demonstration we dive into

security. DEMO
∎ CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent (Custom Rules): Customers can
leverage custom indicators of attack (IOAs) to add their own customised
rules to audit or protect against the testing methodology for this mitigation
strategy. Used alongside global CrowdStrike preventions, these
organisational indicators have unlimited potential to help organisations
identify events defined by specific applications and behaviors. DEMO
∎ CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent (Memory Protection): Because
malware-free or fileless attacks can be carried out entirely in memory,
detection can be challenging. But with new cutting-edge Advanced
Memory Scanning capabilities, organisations can quickly automate highperformance scanning to detect the most advanced attacks. DEMO
∎ CrowdStrike Falcon® Insight XDR (Scheduled Searches): Falcon

environment. This data can be interrogated at any
time and is further enhanced by CrowdStrike Falcon
endpoint detection and response (EDR) telemetry.


Patch Applicatiosns - Mitigation Strategy. Maturity Level Two:
ML2-PA-01 - A vulnerability scanner is
run and reviewed at least weekly to scan
the organisation’s office productivity
suites, web browsers, email clients, PDF
software and security products.
ML2-PA-02 - A vulnerability scanner
is run and reviewed at least fortnightly
to scan the organisation’s other
applications.
ML2-PA-03 - The organisation has an
effective process for patching office
productivity suites, web browsers, email
clients, PDF software and security
products within two weeks.
ML2-PA-04 - Office productivity suites,
web browsers, email clients, PDF
software and security products do not
have security vulnerabilities older than
two weeks.
ML2-PA-05 - Other applications that
have a vulnerability are patched or
mitigated within one month.

Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday is dreaded by every security team. With
dozens of new patches inundating your team every month, how do you
know which to prioritise? How do you know if you have visibility or risk
across applications?
SecOps staff for both government agencies and organisations are
often pressed for time. With the plethora of critical and highly scored
vulnerabilities for applications, a common issue arises where not all
highly scored vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely manner. This
leaves organisations with gaps or flaws within their systems that threat
actors use to exploit organisations for nefarious gain.
Historically, SecOps has relied on vendors to provide some
prioritisation information around this large body of vulnerabilities — but
that is no longer enough. With the limited amount of time typically
allocated for patching and updating systems, critical vulnerabilities
are not being remediated — a situation that can be potentially very
damaging.

CrowdStrike combines the power of its world-class machine learning
and unparalleled intelligence to arm every customer with the insight
they need to prioritise patches and take action across workloads and
applications within your ecosystem.

Why just focus on the inside out? Resilient cybersecurity posture
can only be achieved with a full understanding of your internal and
external attack surface. As the attack surface expands, so does the
“community” of adversaries and cybercriminals exploiting externally
exposed assets to break into organisations around the globe. Gartner
identified attack surface expansion as the number one trend in its
most recent Top Security and Risk Management Trends for 2022,2
turning external attack surface management (EASM) into a critical tool
in the cybersecurity arsenal.
CrowdStrike Falcon® Surface provides a uniquely differentiated
EASM offering, delivering an adversary-driven EASM capability that
minimises risk from unknown, externally exposed assets. With Falcon
Surface, security teams can close security gaps by employing an
outside-in view of the enterprise attack surface. This empowers teams
to prioritise and manage all exposed internet-facing assets that are
centralised or remote across on-premises environments, subsidiary,
cloud and third-party vendors — all with a zero-touch approach.

Customers can build automated workflows using
CrowdStrike Falcon® Fusion integrated security
orchestration automation and response (SOAR) to
trigger incident ticket creation in ServiceNow IT Service
Management (ITSM). Security and DevSecOps teams
can leverage detections and incidents from the Falcon
platform to help streamline incident management
and accelerate response capabilities. You can also
orchestrate remediation of vulnerabilities by creating
ServiceNow tickets directly from Falcon Spotlight, and
easily configure the workflow to attach auto-generated
reports, enabling you to track the remediation progress
of your security team to improve efficiency and
monitoring.

Falcon Surface automatically prioritises risks by leveraging
CrowdStrike’s adversary intelligence to guide precise actions based
on the most critical risks, including natively integrating context of
industry-specific risks, CVE scores for vulnerabilities on exposed
assets, geolocation, attack history and asset type.

This ServiceNow ITSM plugin leverages Falcon Fusion
to allow you to receive Falcon-generated alerts via
ServiceNow ITSM.

JumpCloud empowers your security operations,
IT and DevOps teams to secure and manage your

Conifigure Microsoft Office Settings - Mitigation Strategy. Maturity Level Two:
ML2-OM-01 - Microsoft Office macros in
Microsoft Office files are unable to make
Win32 API calls.
ML2-OM-02 - Allowed execution of
a Microsoft Office macro within a
Microsoft Office file is logged.
ML2-OM-03 - Blocked execution of
a Microsoft Office macro within a
Microsoft Office file is logged.

While adversaries continue to innovate their tactics to remain under
the radar, tried-and-true techniques such as phishing remain popular
among targeted and eCrime operators alike. In the CrowdStrike 2022
Falcon OverWatch Threat Hunting Report, CrowdStrike Intelligence
assessed that adversaries began making the shift to using other
methods in response to Microsoft’s announcement that it would begin
disabling internet-enabled macros in Office documents by default.
Script-based threats such as BokBot and other fileless attacks
are on the rise because they can avoid detection from traditional
file-inspection-based detection capabilities by leveraging trusted
applications that are part of the operating system, and also productivity
applications like Office, to interpret and execute malicious script
content.
Falcon Prevent customers are protected from script-based attacks
using the Falcon platform’s Script-Based Execution Monitoring feature.
The Script Control feature implements a set of components that
provides expanded visibility into a scripting language.
ScriptControl provides AMSI-based and AMSI-emulation-based
introspection of the PowerShell engine. ScriptControl allows the Falcon
sensor to block malicious operations that attempt to hide by translating
high-level operations into multiple lower-level requests, such as:
∎ Contents of executed script files
∎ Typed strings on a PowerShell prompt
∎ Dynamically executed strings through the Invoke-Expression cmdlet
∎ Commands supplied as a command-line parameter, such as
-EncodedCommand
This enables the prevention of malicious VBA macros in Microsoft
Office products as well as malicious VBScript, JScript and Excel 4.0
macros.

Mimecast and CrowdStrike protect organisations at
both the secure email gateway and on endpoint devices.
Joint customers can enhance threat protection through

Rather than simply relying on static signatures and heuristics,
security solutions need to do more to detect and protect against
today’s targeted attacks. They need to identify behaviors that
indicate malicious activity. By identifying malicious or suspicious
behaviors, security solutions can protect against attacks that have
never been seen, including sophisticated fileless attacks.
And because each organisation has unique circumstances and
environments to monitor and protect, tailored security can be
needed for specific or very localised risks such as limiting use of
infrequently used applications or detecting suspicious activity that
isn’t fundamentally malicious.

Falcon Prevent uses the detailed event data collected by the Falcon
agent to develop baseline rules or indicators that identify and prevent
attacks that would otherwise leverage bad behaviors. CrowdStrike
tunes and expands those built-in indicators to offer immediate
protection against the latest attacks.

In addition to the included global IOAs, customers can create
custom IOA rules in the Falcon platform. Because advanced
tactics can be narrowly directed, tailored rules (e.g., preventing
Office from executing files) give customers the ability to create
specific behavioral detections based on what they know about their
environment, applications, specific tools and expected behaviors.

The CrowdStrike Falcon® Zero Trust Assessment (ZTA) expands
Zero Trust beyond authentication to enable detection, alerting and
enforcement of conditional access based on device health and
compliance checks to mitigate risks. With expanded support for
macOS and Linux, Falcon ZTA provides visibility into all endpoints
running across all operating platforms in an organisation.

Falcon ZTA monitors over 120 different unique endpoint settings,
including sensor health, applied CrowdStrike policies and native
operating system (OS) security settings; these settings are a few
of those recommended by the guidelines set forth by Microsoft and
the Center for Internet Security. Customers also receive actionable
reports on findings via the Falcon console and APIs to ensure that
the highest degree of device security is enforced.

Restrict Administrative Privileges - Mitigation Strategy. Maturity Level Two:
ML2-RA-01 - A process for disabling known privileged
accounts exists and is enforced. Users are made aware
of this requirement when being provisioned with a
privileged account.
ML2-RA-02 - There are no privileged accounts that have
an Active Directory expiry date that is greater than 12
months or do not have an expiry date.
ML2-RA-03 - A process for disabling privileged accounts
that have not been used for 45 days exists and is
enforced by the entity. Evidence exists for the usage of
the 45 days inactive disabling process, including support
tickets or administrative logs that show accounts were
disabled.
ML2-RA-04 - There are no enabled privileged accounts
that have a lastlogondate that is greater than 45 days.
ML2-RA-05 - Where a privileged environment is
virtualised, the virtualised image is not located in an
unprivileged environment. This includes virtual machines
on a standard unprivileged SOE.
ML2-RA-06 - Servers are configured to not allow remote
access traffic or connections from systems that are not
jump servers.
ML2-RA-07 - The Microsoft Local Administrator
Password Solution (LAPS) or a similar solution is
implemented on Windows workstations and servers.
ML2-RA-08 - Services account passwords are generated
to be long, unique and unpredictable. Service account
passwords are stored in a secure location, such as a
password manager or a Privileged Access Management
solution.
ML2-RA-09 - Passwords should be changed at least
once every 12 months.
ML2-RA-10 - Successful and failed logins of privileged
accounts are logged.
ML2-RA-11 - Changes made to privileged accounts and
groups within Active Directory are logged.

Access brokers are threat actors who acquire access to
organisations and provide or sell this access to other actors,
including ransomware operators. As outlined in the CrowdStrike
2023 Global Threat Report, the popularity of their services
increased in 2022, with more than 2,500 advertisements for
access identified — a 112% increase compared to 2021.
Why would an attacker hack into a system when they can simply
use stolen credentials to masquerade as an approved user and log
in to the target organisation?
Once inside, attackers increasingly target Microsoft Active
Directory (AD) because it holds the proverbial keys to the
kingdom, providing broad access to the systems, applications,
resources and data that adversaries exploit in their attacks. When
an attacker controls the keys, they can control the organisation.
The problem for security teams and CISOs is they often lack
visibility into the risk presented by AD and identity threats.
With thousands of identities and configurations to manage,
understanding the level of risk and enforcing AD hygiene can be
difficult. But because the ability to detect and stop identity-based
attacks is critical to stopping breaches, understanding the risk that
your AD creates is the best place to start.
CrowdStrike Falcon® Identity Threat Detection (ITD) represents
the first level of detection for AD security. Falcon ITD provides
visibility for identity-based attacks and anomalies, comparing live
traffic against behavior baselines and rules to detect attacks and
lateral movement. It provides real-time AD security alerts on rogue
users and sideways credential movement within the network or
cloud.

Combine best-in-class solutions for
identity management and endpoint
security to strengthen and simplify
secure remote access for trusted
users and devices. Okta and
CrowdStrike have a deeply integrated
joint solution that centralises visibility
and supplies critical user and device
context to access requests. You get
the data-driven insights you need to
support reliable, automated access
decisions, so your teams can support
remote team productivity while
keeping the enterprise safe.

The CyberArk PAM as a Service
solution leverages leading automation
technologies to protect your business
as it grows. The Conditional Access
integration allows clients to leverage
the Falcon ZTA risk score when
determining what level of privileged
access can be granted to a user. If the
Falcon ZTA score exceeds a certain
threshold, the user can be blocked
or their access can be limited until
the issues on the endpoint have been
resolved.

Falcon ITD enables you to:
∎ See all organisational service accounts, privileged users and
user credentials and attributes
∎ Add the context of “who” to network attack discovery and
investigation, with behavioral analysis for each credential
∎ Track every authentication transaction, and alert when the
risk is elevated (e.g., accessing new systems or being granted
additional privileges), or if the traffic is abnormal (varies from
normal patterns of the user behavior)
∎ Expand understanding for both architecture and security
teams by combining context of authentication-level events with
recommended best practices for network security
Seeing user authentication activity everywhere, from local legacy
apps to your cloud environment stack, is the first step toward
effectively managing AD security for identity and access.
CrowdStrike offers a complimentary Active Directory Risk Review
to help security teams achieve visibility, understand risk and
gain insights into the proactive steps that stop identity-based
attacks before they happen. The risk review is powered by the
CrowdStrike Falcon® Identity Threat Protection (ITP) module,
native to the Falcon sensor.

Identity theft and overly permissive accounts are also major
challenges faced by organisations in public and hybrid cloud
environments. As demonstrated with the Sunburst attack, the
adversary is looking to take advantage of the human error and
misconfigurations that can be common with cloud deployments.
Leveraging CrowdStrike’s wealth of cloud experience,
CrowdStrike Falcon® Cloud Security provides cloud security
posture management (CSPM) to help organisations identify those
security issues and indicators of misconfiguration (IOMs) and
IOAs.

options, including on-premises, any
cloud environment, multi-cloud, hybrid
and as a service. Choose the best
authentication method for your users
and applications based on endpoint.

Patch Operating Systems - Mitigation Strategy. Maturity Level Two:
ML2-PO-01 - A vulnerability scanner is run
and reviewed at least weekly to scan the
organisation’s operating systems.
ML2-PO-02 - The organisation has an
effective process for patching operating
systems within two weeks.
ML2-PO-03 - Operating systems that have a
vulnerability are patched or mitigated within
two weeks.

Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday is dreaded by every security team.
With dozens of new patches inundating your team every month,
how do you know which to prioritise? How do you know if
you have visibility of every workload? And let’s not forget that
macOS and Linux carry their own vulnerabilities that need to be
mitigated.
Driven by all of the new technologies being adopted and
the move to the cloud, the number and types of assets an
organisation has to manage increased nearly fourfold over the
last 10 years.3 As a result, organisations are at risk to adversaries,
who continually conduct reconnaissance to identify, target and
exploit soft targets and vulnerabilities.
The proliferation of assets also creates an untenable situation
for IT to minimise service disruption as asset configurations are
changed and patches are applied. Gaining visibility and being
able to manage both known and unknown assets are critical to
maintaining proper security hygiene and a proactive security
posture, but remain an unsolved challenge for nearly every
organisation.
CrowdStrike Asset Graph dynamically monitors and tracks the
complex interactions among assets, providing a single holistic
view of the risks those assets pose, including vulnerabilities.
CrowdStrike Asset Graph provides graph visualisations of the
relationships among all assets such as devices, users, accounts,
applications, cloud workloads and operations technology (OT),
along with the rich context necessary for proper security hygiene
and proactive security posture management to reduce risk in
their organisations — without impacting IT.
Within CrowdStrike Asset Graph, a new relationship mapping
tool provides a comprehensive visual map of how assets are
connected to each other, including how many steps an internetexposed device is from business-critical assets to trace and
shutdown potential adversary paths before they can be used.

Multi-Factor Authentication - Mitigation Strategy. Maturity Level Two:
ML2-MF-01 - A privileged user who is
performing administrative activities is
required to respond to an MFA challenge
at some point in the authentication
lifecycle. This can be implemented when
authenticating to a machine (such as a
jump server) or when attempting to raise
privileges. The organisation has a list of
systems that have privileged users or
support privileged functions.
ML2-MF-02 - The organisation requires that
internet-facing services use multi-factor
authentication that uses either: something
users have and something users know, or
something users have that is unlocked by
something users know or are.
ML2-MF-03 - The organisation requires
that privileged users utilise multi-factor
authentication that uses either: something
users have and something users know, or
something users have that is unlocked by
something users know or are.
ML2-MF-04 - The organisation’s internetfacing systems log successful MFA attempts.
ML2-MF-05 - Administrative access
connections log successful MFA attempts.
ML2-MF-06 - The organisation’s internetfacing systems log unsuccessful MFA
attempts.
ML2-MF-07 - Administrative access
connections log unsuccessful MFA attempts.

Access brokers have become a key component of the
eCrime threat landscape, selling access to threat actors and
facilitating a myriad of criminal activities. Many access brokers
have established relationships with big game hunting (BGH)
ransomware operators and affiliates of prolific
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) programs.
Many intrusion scenarios, as highlighted in the
CrowdStrike 2022 Falcon OverWatch Threat Hunting Report,
feature the exploitation of remote access services and the use
of RDP and some form of valid account.
Multifactor authentication (MFA) has become a crucial method
for controlling access to critical applications and resources,
and a key control in deterring threat actors who purchase
compromised credentials from access brokers.
One way to enforce identity verification is to trigger MFA every
time a user tries to access a resource or application. This can
create MFA fatigue, which not only may reduce user productivity
but also potentially creates a risk scenario in which the user
inadvertently allows access to a malicious sign-in attempt.
Customers using Falcon identity protection solutions gain a
better user experience and improved security with risk-based
MFA: The user’s trust is evaluated in real time to determine
whether to allow access to specific resources even before
the authentication request hits the AD. With baselines and
dynamic risks tied to every identity and its behavior, malicious
activity — such as lateral movement, risky behavior, unusual
endpoint usage, privilege escalation and malicious RDP login
attempts — is detected and challenged in real time without
requiring cumbersome log analytics or point solutions.
Prioritising security controls in these areas, such as
implementing MFA, would help in many cases. When it comes to
hunting for precursors of ransomware activity, identifying lateral
movement between critical assets such as domain controllers
and backup servers is also crucial.

Combine best-in-class solutions for identity
management and endpoint security to strengthen
and simplify secure remote access for trusted users
and devices. Okta and CrowdStrike have a deeply
integrated joint solution that centralises visibility and
supplies critical user and device context to access
requests. You get the data-driven insights you need
to support reliable, automated access decisions, so
your teams can support remote team productivity
while keeping the enterprise safe.

Falcon identity protection solutions automatically classify
and assess the privileges of all identities — think of it as
next-generation privileged access security — with visibility and
security control of all accounts tied to AD, Azure AD and SSOs
like Okta, Ping and Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).
With identity segmentation and visibility into behavior and risks
for all users, organisations can restrict access to high-value
resources and stop ransomware attacks from progressing, thus
allowing organisations to adopt a broader identity protection
strategy.
The identity attack surface can also be influenced by a single nonprivileged account, so you shouldn’t narrow security efforts to only
privileged accounts. It is important to understand that traditional
privileged access management (PAM) solutions provide visibility
into only privileged accounts. In addition to requiring careful
planning to deploy and configure a PAM solution, organisations
should consider the probability that jump servers can be
bypassed and password vaults can be compromised.
Think of PAM as an “operational” solution to “manage”
privileged accounts. For example, PAM solutions do not prevent
the misuse of valid credentials, they only manage the use of
privileged accounts — however, a privileged account from PAM
could still be used by a skilled adversary to go undetected
within a customer environment.
Falcon identity protection solutions can complement your
PAM solution by enabling holistic visibility, analytics and
protection for your privileged identities and service accounts,
and enforcement of risk-based MFA — improving the user
experience for your administrators.
∎ Falcon ITP (Zero Trust): DEMO
CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence Recon, CrowdStrike’s digital
risk protection solution, goes beyond the dark web to include
forums with restricted access on the deep web, breach data
and messaging apps — all resources commonly used by
access brokers to trade or advertise. Falcon Intelligence Recon
provides customers with an increased level of situational
awareness and helps uncover potential malicious activity before
eCrime adversaries have the chance to exploit it.

Beyond Identity eliminates the vulnerabilities of
passwords and the inconvenience of traditional
MFA. It ensures high confidence in identity claims
by cryptographically binding a user identity to their
devices. The solution leverages X.509 certificates
and the TLS protocol without any certificate
management required by customers.
The integration of Beyond Identity’s advanced,
passwordless MFA with CrowdStrike’s leading
endpoint protection stops the two most prevalent
sources of ransomware and account takeover
attacks: passwords and compromised endpoints.
The integration provides a critical and foundational
layer for Zero Trust, enabling an extremely hightrust method of authenticating users (employees,
contractors, and consultants) and ensuring they are
only able to gain access from endpoint devices that
meet security policy requirements and those that
are given a clean bill of health by Beyond Identity
and CrowdStrike.

TruU replaces hackable passwords with
continuously validated identity that adapts to
how people work so they can be protected and
productive.
TruU and CrowdStrike take the Falcon ZTA score
from the endpoint and combine that into the TruU
risk score using the TruU Risk Engine. The TruU
risk score is compared against the score indicated
by the policy threshold and if the score is within the
bounds, the user is logged into the computer with
TruU presence alone. If the score is higher than the
threshold then another factor is required for access.

Regular backups - Mitigation Strategy. Maturity Level Two:
ML2-RB-01 - Privileged users (excluding
backup administrator accounts) are
unable to access backups that do not
belong to them.
ML2-RB-02 - Privileged users (excluding
backup administrator accounts) are
unable to modify and delete backups.

ECrime adversaries remain highly capable, particularly if measured by
the speed at which they can move through a victim’s environment. An
important Falcon OverWatch speed measurement is breakout time: the
time an adversary takes to move laterally, from an initially compromised
host to another host within the victim environment. According to the
CrowdStrike 2022 Falcon OverWatch Threat Hunting Report, of the
hands-on eCrime intrusion activity observed between July 2021 and
June 2022 where breakout time could be derived, the average was just
1 hour 24 minutes. Moreover, the Falcon OverWatch team found that
in 30% of those eCrime intrusions, the adversary was able to move
laterally to additional hosts in under 30 minutes.
Without a data backup, companies are often at a complete loss when
a ransomware attack occurs. Backups are normally the quickest and
most reliable way to recover.
The LockBit ransomware family has constantly been adding new
capabilities, including tampering with Microsoft Server Volume
Shadow Copy Service (VSS) and System Restore by interacting with
the legitimate Windows tools. Capabilities such as lateral movement
or destruction of shadow copies are some of the most effective and
pervasive tactics ransomware uses.
The tampering and deletion of VSS shadow copies is a common
tactic to prevent data recovery. Adversaries will often abuse
legitimate Microsoft administrator tools to disable and remove VSS
shadow copies. Common tools include Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI), BCDEdit (a command-line tool for managing
Boot Configuration Data) and vssadmin.exe.
LockBit 2.0 utilises the following WMI command line for deleting
shadow copies and disabling system recovery:
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c vssadmin delete
shadows /all /quiet & wmic shadowcopy delete
& bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy
ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set {default}
recoveryenabled no
The use of preinstalled operating system tools, such as WMI, is
not new. Still, adversaries have started abusing them as part of the
initial access tactic to perform tasks without requiring a malicious
executable file to be run or written to the disk on the compromised
system.

Falcon Prevent takes a layered approach to detecting and preventing
ransomware developed by eCrime actors, by using behavior-based
IOAs and advanced machine learning, among other capabilities.
CrowdStrike is committed to continually improving the efficacy of its
technologies against known and unknown threats and adversaries.
CrowdStrike’s enhanced IOA detections accurately distinguish
malicious behavior from benign, resulting in high-confidence
detections. This is especially important when ransomware shares
similar capabilities with legitimate software, like backup solutions.
Both can enumerate directories and write files that on the surface
may seem inconsequential, but when correlated with other indicators
on the endpoint, can identify a legitimate attack.
The Falcon platform offers protection against ransomware incidents,
which is increasingly valuable as the popularity of ransomware
continues to rise. CrowdStrike’s approach is to stop ransomware
from infecting a system and encrypting its files. CrowdStrike believes
a prevention approach is absolutely necessary because decryption
is often impossible and no organisation wants to pay the ransom,
leaving often-cumbersome restoration from backups as a last resort.
Falcon Prevent protects shadow copies from being tampered with,
adding another protection layer to mitigate ransomware attacks.
Protecting shadow copies helps potentially compromised systems
restore encrypted data with much less time and effort. Ultimately, this
helps reduce operational costs associated with person-hours spent
spinning up encrypted systems post-compromise.
The Falcon platform can prevent suspicious processes from
tampering with shadow copies and performing actions such as
changing file size to render the backup useless. For instance, should
a LockBit 2.0 ransomware infection occur and attempt to use the
legitimate Microsoft administrator tool (vssadmin.exe) to manipulate
shadow copies, Falcon immediately detects this behavior and
prevents the ransomware from deleting or tampering with them.

By combining the Falcon Fusion integrated SOAR solution with
Falcon RTR, which provides surgical remote remediation capabilities,
responders are able to automate post-remediation actions including:
running checks on the system to ensure it is clean, running custom
scripts and executables, issuing automated notifications via
collaboration channels like email, Slack or Microsoft Teams, and
updating ticket status on IT management systems like ServiceNow
and Jira.
∎ Falcon Prevent (Falcon RTR): Falcon RTR is a tool that can provide
as many unique solutions as there are threats. Because response
to a cybersecurity incident can be as unique as the attack itself,
there is no “one-click-fixes-all” solution. DEMO
∎ Falcon Fusion: Falcon Fusion integrates with Falcon RTR to provide
powerful incident response and remediation across the entire
Falcon platform via a simple drag-and-drop experience that works
at scale across a multi-platform technology stack.

Crowdstrike White Paper - Securing Cloud Infrastructure: 
The top four threats to your cloud journey <

Cloud adoption has brought a wave of change to today's businesses, from enhanced internal
collaboration and consumer engagement to improved agility and cost savings. The growth
of private, public and hybrid cloud use among enterprises has done more than spur digital
transformation; it has also broadened the infrastructure businesses need to secure. To safely embrace the cloud and realize its benefits, organizations need visibility into a larger and more complex landscape than ever before.

There are four broad categories of security issues in the cloud: human errors, runtime threats, shadow IT and poor strategic planning. In this white paper, we will dive into these issues and discuss how and why they pose a challenge to securing the cloud. 

	1. Human Errors
Of all four categories, human error is the one most often blamed for cloud breaches. According to Gartner, 99% of all cloud security failures through 2025 will be the customer’s fault.

These errors often take the form of misconfigured Amazon S3 buckets, open ports and the use
of unsecure accounts or APIs. If left undetected, they can open the door for attackers looking to compromise cloud environments.

A key challenge to addressing human error is visibility. It is difficult for security to keep pace with the need to support the constantly changing and elastic reality of the cloud. In addition, using multiple point solutions to manage security across different cloud services as well as their onpremises environment has left many organizations struggling to maintain consistent security policies and enforcement. Without the ability to identify and remediate unsecure APIs and misconfigurations, cloud workloads can go from being IT assets to IT threats.

	2. Runtime Threats
That statement is also true as it relates to workloads that are targeted using zero-day exploits. In public clouds, much of the underlying infrastructure is protected by the cloud service provider (CSP). 

However, organizations that fail to understand the shared responsibility model — which
delineates the responsibilities of the CSP and the customer — sometimes create security holes for threat actors to exploit. This situation can enable attackers to target the operating system and application to obtain access. From there, they can potentially gain persistence through the use of malware or other techniques and move laterally throughout the organization’s environment.

In addition to attempting to gain a larger foothold in the environment, adversaries may also
target intellectual property and confidential information stored in the cloud. The CrowdStrike Cybersecurity Services team has noted this trend this year across numerous breach investigations.

Even if a cloud workload is properly configured, it may still be susceptible to unpatched
vulnerabilities and zero-days, making runtime threats a critical concern for today’s enterprises.

	3. Shadow IT

Visibility issues are exacerbated by shadow IT, which by its nature circumvents the normal IT approval and management process. Usually, shadow IT is not created for malicious reasons. Its creation is typically the result of employees adopting cloud services to do their jobs. The ease with which cloud resources can be spun up and down makes controlling its growth difficult.

These unauthorized assets can threaten the environment because they are often not properly
secured and are accessible via default passwords and misconfigurations. With cloud and
DevOps teams looking to maintain high velocity, obtaining the visibility and management levels that security teams require is challenging.

DevOps teams want a frictionless way to ensure that they deploy secure applications and that
their security solutions directly integrate with their continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. There needs to be a unified approach for security teams to get the information they need without slowing down DevOps, and both security and IT teams will need to adapt and collaborate to meet each other’s needs.

	4. Lack of Cloud Security Strategy and skills
The final critical security issue facing the cloud is the skills shortage and the lack of a cloud security strategy inside many organizations. As a result, many administrators attempt to secure cloud workloads the same way they secure their on-premises data centers. Unfortunately, traditional data center security models do not apply to cloud computing, and poor planning can open up new risks and vulnerabilities.

A key part of any strategy for cloud adoption is education — educating teams on security best practices such as how to store secrets, how to rotate keys and how to practice good IT hygiene during software development is critical. However, this piece of the puzzle is often overlooked.

DevOps may be happening, but DevSecOps often is not — which is hampering the industry’s
ability to make the cloud secure.

CrowdStrike fights to help organizations reduce their attack surface through a dynamic, cloudnative security strategy. The CrowdStrike Falcon® platform provides comprehensive visibility across CrowdStrike’s cloud infrastructure. In fact, the cornerstone of CrowdStrike’s internal cloud visibility strategy can be summed up as “Falcon everywhere.” 
This approach consists of deploying the Falcon agent on all cloud workloads and containers and employing the Falcon OverWatch™ team to proactively hunt for threats 24/7.

In addition, CrowdStrike uses specific cloud-native indicators of attack (IOA), analyzes machine learning (ML) patterns and performs free-form threat hunting, looking for hands-on-keyboard activity by adversaries within CrowdStrike’s cloud workloads and control plane.

Crowdstrike Guidebook - Reducing the Attack Surface: Five ways organisations
can reduce risk within a multi-cloud environment. <

Public cloud services have become a necessary component for most organizations’ long-term strategic growth plans. But as the cloud enables new ways of working, it also raises important considerations for how organizations must adapt and expand their cybersecurity capabilities to protect their assets, data and customers within the cloud environment.

Organizations with a multi-cloud environment have an expanded attack surface. Their cybersecurity strategy does not revolve around physical data centers and on-premises servers, but a vast, sprawling network of endpoints, as well as virtual servers, remote applications, cloud workloads, containers and the network communications between the environments.

This paper shares five main ways that organizations can reduce the risk of exposure by continually searching for and removing unnecessary attack surfaces within a multi-cloud environment.

Traditional security measures don't work in the cloud because there is no perimeter to protect, manual processes cannot occur at the necessary scale or speed, the lack of centralisation makes visibility extremely difficult to achieve strategy. 

	1. Segmentation
Segmentation is a security technique that divides the cloud environment into smaller zones to maintain separate access to every part of the network. These segments help contain attacks and limit damage in the event of a breach.

Segmentation can be based on device type or functions as well as user identity. It entails using different cloud accounts, virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets and roles for different types of workloads. Organizations should also strive to avoid overlapping
production, development and integration workloads.

	2. Encryption
Cloud encryption is the process of transforming data from its original plain text format to an unreadable format, such as ciphertext, before it is transferred to and stored in the cloud.

This process renders the information indecipherable and therefore useless without the encryption keys. This applies even if the data is lost, stolen or shared with an unauthorized user.

Every reputable cloud service provider (CSP) — the business or entity that owns and operates the cloud — offers basic security, including encryption. However, cloud users should implement additional measures to ensure data security.

For organizations that use a cloud-based model or are beginning the shift to the cloud, it is important to develop and deploy a comprehensive data security strategy that is specifically designed to protect and defend cloud-based assets. Organizations should consult
their cybersecurity partner to select an optimal third-party encryption
tool and integrate it within the existing security tech stack. 

	3. Devsecops
Incorporating security at an earlier point in the software development lifecycle — a practice also known as DevSecOps — serves the dual purpose of increasing quality while reducing risk.

While many DevOps teams may have been reluctant to follow such an approach in the past, today’s threat landscape all but requires a security-first mindset. Further, shifting left helps avoid delays later in the development process, when problems are more
complex, costly and time-consuming to address.

A comprehensive security strategy can help mitigate issues within the development process by implementing tools, automation and standards to enable engineers to easily follow the desired security behavior. These tools reduce developer friction as well as diminish
the likelihood that unsafe or default configurations will be used.


	4. Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
Multifactor authentication (MFA) is the process of requiring
more than one piece of evidence to authenticate a user’s
identity. This evidence may include security questions, email/
text confirmation or logic-based exercises to assess the user’s
credibility.

MFA is an absolute necessity within every cloud-native security
strategy. Organizations should also consider using hard tokens for
high-impact environments such as GovCloud deployments.

	5. Cloud security posture management 
Over the course of each day, the cloud may connect and
disconnect from hundreds or even thousands of other networks.
This dynamic nature makes security more difficult to achieve, as
visibility and discoverability can be challenging.

Given the dynamic nature of the cloud, it is important to
proactively maintain good IT hygiene by automatically discovering
the cloud workload footprint.

Cloud security posture management (CSPM) automates
the identification and remediation of risks across cloud
infrastructures, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS),
software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).
CSPM is used for risk visualization and assessment, incident
response, compliance monitoring and DevSecOps integration,
and can uniformly apply best practices for cloud security to
hybrid, multi-cloud and container environments.

Comprehensive CSPM capabilities allow the organization to:
• Establish a single source of truth across multi-cloud
environments and accounts, thus improving visibility and
discoverability
• Automatically discover cloud resources and details — including
misconfigurations, metadata, networking, security and change
activity — upon deployment
• Eliminate security risks by identifying misconfigurations, open
IP ports, unauthorized modifications and other issues that leave
cloud resources exposed
• Proactively detect threats across the application development
lifecycle by cutting through the noise of multi-cloud environment
security alerts with a targeted threat identification and
management approach
• Continuously monitor the environment for malicious activity,
unauthorized activity and unauthorized access to cloud
resources using real-time threat detection

Endpoint Protection Buyers Guide: The five essential elements of cloud-based endpoint protection <

Endpoint security is one of the most critical components of a cybersecurity strategy.
Unfortunately, for those responsible for protecting their organizations’ endpoints,
it has never been more challenging to select the best solution for the job. With so
many options on the market and features that sound identical, choosing an endpoint
protection solution is anything but straightforward.

CrowdStrike believes that truly effective endpoint protection must provide the highest
level of security and simplicity — because complexity strains teams and processes,
ultimately introducing security gaps and increasing risk. To achieve both security
and simplicity, endpoint protection must include five key elements and be delivered
through a cloud-native architecture. 

These objectives can be used as guidelines when
evaluating and choosing an endpoint protection platform:
• Prevention to keep out as many malicious elements as possible
• Detection to find and remove attackers
• Managed threat hunting to elevate detection beyond automation
• Threat intelligence integration to understand and stay ahead of attackers
• Vulnerability management and IT hygiene to prepare and strengthen the
environment against threats and attacks.

These five elements need to be enabled, integrated and delivered via cloud-native
architecture in order to simplify operations and meet the speed, flexibility and capacity
required to fend off modern attackers.

So how do you evaluate these elements and find the right solution for your
organization? Start by asking the right questions.

We’ve developed this guide to help you ask those questions and get the information
you need to measure and compare different solutions.

As you dive in and gain insight, you’ll find CrowdStrike sets a high bar. CrowdStrike
delivers everything needed to stop breaches — simply and smartly. The CrowdStrike
Falcon® cloud-native endpoint protection platform unifies technology, intelligence
and expertise into one solution that’s tested and proven to stop breaches. It combines
all essential elements in a single agent that can be deployed within minutes, with
virtually no impact on endpoints or users. The cloud-native Falcon platform delivers
truly effective endpoint protection with the highest-level security and simplicity.

Protecting endpoints has long been a critical component of all security strategies,
as they are among the prime targets for attackers. Adversaries often try to exploit
crisis and change, and the pandemic has been no exception. 

With new, often unsecured access points to networks and data along with accelerated setup of
new infrastructure, threat actors have been taking advantage of this expanded
attack surface and increased both the volume and the reach of their activities.

Increasing threat velocity, along with the need for rapid change as more
applications, infrastructure and data move into the cloud, shifted the focus for
many security and IT teams. They realize they must be nimble, be efficient and
keep security top-of-mind. This transition has placed an even greater emphasis
on protection of the endpoint — the new perimeter for many.

This guide was created to help security professionals by defining the critical
elements of endpoint protection required to effectively protect an organization
against modern threats.

It takes more than a collection of capabilities gathered under one umbrella to qualify as a
capable endpoint protection solution. To be truly effective, an endpoint protection solution
must be designed to continuously stop breaches across the entire attack continuum.

Yesterday’s techniques for detecting and blocking threats at the endpoint are ineffective
against today’s modern threats. Breaches can no longer be reliably prevented by monitoring
and scanning files and looking for known bads.

Security effectiveness is directly related to the quantity and quality of data you're able to collect, and your ability to analyze it regardless of where it comes from. Preventing breaches requires taking this data and applying the best tools, including artificial intelligence (AI), behavioral analytics, threat intelligence and human threat hunters. Effective solutions must leverage this massive data to continuously anticipate where the next serious threat will appear, in time to act.

Harnessing the data and tools to effectively stop breaches requires a scalable, cloud-native
platform — a security cloud. A cloud-native approach enables the seamless aggregation, sharing and operationalization of this information to deliver the kind of anticipation, prevention, detection, visibility and response capabilities that can beat a determined attacker time and time again.

To get those capabilities, decision-makers should look for five critical elements in a cloudnative endpoint protection solution. 

	1. Critical Element 1: Prevention
PROTECTING AGAINST MALWARE AND BEYOND WITH NGAV
There are sound reasons why traditional, malware-centric endpoint protection products simply do not provide an adequate level of protection against today’s threats and adversaries.

Malware-centric protection does not address the increasingly sophisticated fileless and malware-free tactics used by modern adversaries. In fact, the CrowdStrike 2020 Global Threat Report noted that the trend toward malware-free attacks is accelerating, with these types of attacks surpassing the volume of malware attacks in 2020.

An effective endpoint protection solution needs to solve this challenge by expanding beyond simply identifying and addressing known malware. First, it should protect against both known and unknown malware by using technologies such as machine learning (ML) that do not require daily updates. 

It should look beyond malware and fully leverage behavioral analytics to automatically look for signs of attack and block them as they are occurring. In addition, the ideal endpoint protection solution should protect endpoints against all types of threats — from known and unknown malware to fileless and malware-free attacks — by combining all of the necessary technologies for ultimate protection.

• How often does the product need to be updated to ensure the highest level of protection?
• What can the product prevent when offline, if the user opens a file or executable, or performs
malicious actions when not connected to the internet?
• How quickly are new OS versions supported?
• Do updates to the sensor require reboots? If so, what impact does this have on critical hosts and servers?

Provide rapidresponse andremediation:

Required Features
• The ability to quarantine a malicious file
• Keeps detection information for at least 90 days for investigation

The Crowdstrike approach: 
The CrowdStrike Falcon endpoint protection platform provides a new generation
of prevention features, capable of defeating the sophisticated tools and
techniques used by today’s attackers and filling the gap left by signature-based
antivirus solutions. The Falcon platform combines an array of powerful methods
to provide prevention against the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that
make modern attacks successful. 

That combination of methods allows Falcon to
not only protect against commodity malware but also prevent zero-day malware,
exploits and importantly, fileless and malware-free attacks. Falcon uses the
right prevention feature at the right time to block threats across the entire attack
continuum.

Falcon employs ML on the endpoint for pre-execution prevention of both known
and unknown malware. Its ML feature is so powerful that it has protected Falcon
customers from the ransomware WannaCry, NotPetya and Ryuk, right out of the
box — without requiring any action or update from the user.

Falcon also uses exploit mitigation to defend against attackers that leverage
exploits as part of either malware-based or malwarefree attacks. Exploit
mitigation consists of stopping vulnerability exploit attempts, from both known
and zero-day exploits, to prevent hosts from being compromised.
Against sophisticated attackers that will not limit their tactics to the use of
malware and exploits, Falcon uses IOAs. 

These are behavior-based algorithms
focused on detecting the intent of the attackers, or what they are trying to
accomplish, regardless of the tools used in the attack. IOA-based prevention
capabilities allow customers to prevent threats that bypass traditional
technologies such as signatures or allowlisting.

Always-on protection means endpoints are secure, whether online or offline. The
lightweight Falcon agent has little impact in endpoints, from initial install to day-today use, and no reboot is required after installation. 

	2. Critical Element 2: Detection
Because attackers expect to encounter prevention measures on a target, they
have refined their craft to include techniques designed to bypass prevention.
These techniques include credential theft, fileless attacks or software supply
chain attacks. When an attacker is able to gain a foothold without any alarm being
raised, it is called “silent failure,” which allows attackers to dwell in an environment
for days, weeks or even months without detection. The remedy for silent failure
is EDR, which provides the visibility security teams need to uncover attackers as
rapidly as possible.

A fully functioning EDR system should tightly integrate with the prevention
capability. It should record all activities of interest on an endpoint for deeper
inspection, both in real time and after the fact. It should enrich this data with threat
intelligence to provide needed context — critical for hunting and investigation. An
efficient EDR solution should also be intelligent and able to automatically detect
malicious activity and present real attacks (not benign activity) without requiring
security teams to write and fine-tune detection rules.
Equally important, the EDR system needs to offer an easy way to mitigate a
breach that is uncovered. This could mean containing the exposed endpoints to
stop the breach in its tracks, allowing remediation to take place before damage
occurs.

CrowdStrike Falcon Insight™ EDR monitors and records activities taking place
on the endpoint, providing the real-time and historical visibility necessary
to detect attackers activity while enabling security teams to investigate and
resolve incidents quickly. This approach stops attackers before they do damage,
essentially eliminating the risk of silent failure.

Falcon also provides both automatic and human-driven analysis capabilities that
can be performed as events are taking place or after the fact. The automatic
analysis can immediately detect and intelligently prioritize malicious and attacker
activity. The manual analysis capability grants security teams the deep visibility
and context they need for proactive threat hunting, fast incident investigation and
remediation. In addition, CrowdStrike’s cloud-native architecture provides the
speed and scalability to collect and retain all of the necessary endpoint events,
even if the endpoints are unavailable, destroyed or have been deleted (as can be
the case for virtual workloads).

CrowdStrike Threat Graph® database, the brain behind the Falcon platform,
ingests and analyzes more than 5 trillion events in real time every week, making
the Falcon security cloud platform one of the industry's most advanced sources of
truth for security insight and adversary intelligence. The CrowdScore™ capability,
an innovative detection feature of Falcon Insight, is constantly processing data in
Threat Graph, looking for malicious activity by examining all behaviors, whether or
not they have been alerted to the user. It is not simply grouping atomic alerts; rather,
it is searching for and weighing the evidence of activity that comprises attacker
behavior, whether or not it was previously alerted to the user. When an attack is
detected, an incident is created. CrowdScore addresses alert fatigue by detecting
attacks rather than detecting specific behaviors, resulting in a 98% average
reduction in items requiring analysis (comparing alert counts to incident counts).
From a single console, Falcon Insight provides real-time visibility, historical events
and the means to analyze data to ensure that organizations can quickly identify
any potential silent failures and appropriately respond with the necessary tools.

	3. Critical Element 3 - Managed Threat Hunting:

Passively waiting for security products to automatically detect attacks will not
uncover and stop sophisticated hidden threats. This is illustrated by the ongoing
breaches that happen even in environments where new and advanced security
technology has been deployed. This is because passive automated alerts rely
on preset parameters that can be tested and bypassed by determined attackers.
This is why proactive threat hunting, led by human security experts, is a must-have
for any organization looking to achieve or improve real-time threat detection and
incident response.
 
Threat hunting plays a critical role in the early detection of attacks and
adversaries. It constitutes a proactive approach that is human-led and actively
searches for suspicious activities rather than passively relying on technology to
automatically detect and alert on a potential attacker’s activity. Early detection
and investigation of such activity allow organizations to stop attacks before they
can do damage.

Unfortunately, a lack of resources and a shortage in security expertise makes
proactive threat hunting unattainable for a majority of organizations. Understaffed
internal teams are unable to monitor 24/7 for adversary activity, and in many
cases, they are not equipped to efficiently respond to extremely sophisticated
attacks. This can result in longer investigation times with fewer alerts being
handled in a timely manner, ultimately resulting in longer dwell times and
increased risk that attackers will successfully accomplish their goals.
Managed threat hunting solves this challenge by providing an elite hunting team
that not only finds malicious activities that may have been missed by automated
security systems, but also analyzes them thoroughly and provides customers with
response guidelines.

	4. Critical Element 4 - Anticipation
Attackers move so quickly and stealthily that it is challenging for both protection
technologies and security professionals to keep up with the latest threats and
proactively protect against them. Threat intelligence enables security products
and security teams to understand and effectively predict the cyber threats that
might impact them. It empowers organizations to anticipate the "who" and "how" of
the next attack, and allows security teams to focus on prioritizing and configuring
resources so they can respond effectively to future attacks.

In addition, threat intelligence provides the information that allows security teams
to understand, respond to and resolve incidents faster, accelerating investigations
and incident remediation. This is why security professionals looking at endpoint
protection must ensure that they do not focus solely on the security infrastructure.
It is important that actionable threat intelligence is included as part of the total
solution. Putting the appropriate information at security teams’ fingertips allows
faster and better decisions and responses. When looking at such integration,
customers need to ensure that the intelligence provided is seamlessly integrated
into the endpoint protection solution and that its consumption can be automated.
Use Table 4 to guide your evaluation of the threat intelligence integration provided
in the endpoint protection solutions you are considering.

CrowdStrike Falcon is the first platform to seamlessly integrate threat intelligence
into endpoint protection, automating incident investigations and speeding breach
response. The instant analysis of threats that reach endpoints, combined with the
expertise of the global CrowdStrike Intelligence team, enables any security team
— regardless of size or sophistication — to make predictive security a reality.
Falcon delivers the critical intelligence security teams need to stay ahead of
attackers and to prioritize and respond to incidents as fast as possible and in the
most appropriate way. Falcon takes full advantage of the information and insights
provided by the CrowdStrike Intelligence team to provide additional context to
alerts and incidents.

This dramatically reduces the resource-draining complexity of incident
investigations and takes endpoint detection and response alerts to the next level.
It not only shows what happened on the endpoint, but also provides attribution
and reveals “the who, why and how” behind the attack. For example, Falcon
automatically provides attribution of tools, domains, IPs, tactics and techniques
to known adversaries. It provides detailed adversary profiles that help proactively
protect against those threat actors, if found in an environment.

Finally, Falcon can automate malware analysis to deliver actionable intelligence
and custom IOCs that specifically match the threats encountered on an
organization’s endpoints. With this level of automation, security teams can very
quickly prioritize which threats they need to analyze first and allocate their
resources to the analysis rather than the prioritization.

Falcon combines the tools used by world-class cyber threat investigators into a
seamless solution and performs the investigations automatically. This tight and
automatic integration between Falcon and threat intelligence enables all teams,
regardless of size or sophistication, to understand better, respond faster and
proactively get ahead of the attackers.

	5. Critical Element 5 - Readiness
Security starts with closing gaps to reduce the attack surface and be better
prepared to face threats. This requires understanding which systems and
applications are vulnerable and who and what are active in your environment. That
is why vulnerability management and IT hygiene are the foundational blocks of an
efficient security practice and should be part of any robust endpoint protection
solution. They provide the visibility and actionable information that security and
IT teams need to implement preemptive measures and make sure that they are
prepared to face today’s sophisticated threats.

When it comes to vulnerability assessment and management, regular, continuous
monitoring is critical to identify and prioritize the weaknesses within your
organization’s systems. For example, if you have out-of-date applications, but do
not continuously monitor for vulnerabilities, your environment could become a
key attack vector for adversaries. Thus, the ability to discover, patch and update
vulnerable applications running in your environment provides a tremendous
advantage against attackers.

The same goes for IT hygiene. Knowing who and what is on your network can
enable IT to work proactively in addressing unknowns or gaps within your security
architecture. IT hygiene solutions offer the ability to pinpoint unmanaged systems
or those that could be a risk on the network, such as unprotected BYOD or thirdparty systems. This solution should also be continuously monitoring for changes
within your assets, applications and users.

Credential theft continues to be another popular and efficient vector for attackers.
Monitoring and gaining visibility into logon trends (activities/duration) across your
environment, wherever credentials are being used and administrator credentials
created, enables security teams to detect and mitigate credential abuse and
attacks that employ stolen credentials.

Vulnerability management and IT hygiene provide security teams with the
information they need to take an efficient proactive stance to improve their overall
security posture and be in the best position to face adversaries.

As organizations grow and add more distributed endpoints, on-premises
endpoint security solutions can quickly become very complex and take months
to implement and be fully operational. Soon, it seems the entire infrastructure
needs to be updated to ensure that it operates at the highest level of protection, or
a different component needs to be added to protect against a new type of threat.
This often requires the entire implementation procedure to start all over again —
meanwhile leaving gaps in your protection.

Hybrid deployments with components distributed between on-premises and
in the cloud may seem like a logical choice, but they introduce challenges.
Infrastructure overhead continues if any on-premises management component is
required. Versioning quickly layers in complexity and introduces security gaps as
capabilities, protection and update routines vary across the estate. Decentralized
data repositories limit detection and response capabilities.

Cloud-native, on the other hand, offers a means of providing pervasive protection
throughout the enterprise faster, at a lower cost and with reduced management
overhead while offering significantly increased performance, agility and
scalability. Without hardware and additional software to procure, deploy, manage
and update, rolling out endpoint security from the cloud becomes quick and
simple. While on-premises systems can take up to a year to fully roll out, cloudbased solutions can be successfully deployed in environments with tens of
thousands of hosts in a matter of hours.

Additionally, updates to the infrastructure are done in the cloud, immediately,
under vendor supervision and do not require months of planning that can leave
gaps in the protection efficacy and deplete IT teams’ resources.
Other benefits of a cloud-native model include the ability to collect rich data sets
in real time and to scale on demand, making it possible to store petabytes of data
for months and analyze that data in seconds without impacting endpoints. Those
are all extremely arduous tasks that are not suited for on-premises models. Finally,
cloud deployments are crucial for protecting remote systems when they are off
the network or outside the VPN.

A well-designed cloud architecture should provide the following capabilities:
1. Be immediately operational with no infrastructure setup prior to deployment
2. Scale seamlessly as endpoints and events are added, without requiring the
customer’s intervention
3. Reduce impact on endpoints to a minimum (e.g., no database required on
the endpoint to keep event data, no endpoint resource consumption when
search or analysis is done)
4. Analyze data at a speed and volume that provide fast and accurate results

The following questions will help you uncover the true abilities provided by an
endpoint protection solution's cloud architecture:
• How long does it take for the product to be fully operational?
• What additional hardware and software — servers (physical or virtual),
• appliances, database licenses, etc. — are required to implement the product?
• Is it a true cloud-designed architecture or a virtualized appliance hosted in the
cloud?
• Does the customer need to do anything if the number of endpoints grows or if
they add additional locations to the environment?
• How does the solution impact endpoints, disk space, CPU usage and RAM
usage?
• How are the endpoints impacted when searches are performed and when
events are collected?
• How many events per second can the cloud infrastructure handle?
• How many endpoints can the architecture support?

The CrowdStrike Falcon platform's cloud-native architecture was designed and
implemented from the ground up to leverage the power and scale of the cloud.

It allows CrowdStrike to provide immediate time-to-value, which means that
customers can be up, running and fully operational in hours, as opposed to the
weeks or months usually required for on-premises architectures.

In addition to enabling fast and easy implementation, with extremely low
maintenance and expansion costs, CrowdStrike’s purpose-built cloud
architecture delivers a series of unique and powerful advantages that both
strengthen protection and reduce complexity.

This architecture is central to CrowdStrike’s ability to collect, analyze and store
trillions of events per week, which would be nearly impossible to achieve with onpremises architecture. The CrowdStrike security cloud model, one of the biggest
cloud architectures in the world, is designed for storing and analyzing a large,
ever-growing volume of data. It provides complete real-time visibility and insight into
everything happening on your endpoints, workloads and containers throughout your
environment. Using powerful graph analytics to scour billions of events in real time,
CrowdStrike Threat Graph draws links between security events across the global
Falcon agent community to immediately detect and prevent adversary activity, at
scale and with unprecedented speed. When a new threat is discovered locally in one
environment, all customers benefit from CrowdStrike community-driven intelligence
immediately due to Threat Graph’s ability to analyze data at cloud scale and take the
most effective action to protect all customers. In this way, Threat Graph empowers
CrowdStrike customers with an extraordinary level of protection against breaches.
The Falcon platform is designed as a highly modular and extensible solution using
a single lightweight agent. This ensures that customers can solve new security
challenges with a single click — without the need to re-architect or re-engineer the
solution, removing friction associated with security deployments.

It might seem hard to see the difference between vendors, but when you look
beyond the hype, you can see that only CrowdStrike delivers the essential endpoint
protection capabilities:
1. Prevention to keep out as many malicious elements as possible
2. Detection to find and remove attackers
3. Managed threat hunting to elevate detection beyond automation
4. Threat intelligence integration to understand and stay ahead of attackers
5. Vulnerability management and IT hygiene to prepare and strengthen the
environment against threats and attacks.

CrowdStrike uniquely enables and delivers these elements via a cloud-native
architecture to meet the speed, flexibility and capacity required to fend off modern
attackers and stop breaches. It delivers a single lightweight agent for prevention,
detection, threat hunting, response, remediation, vulnerability management and
IT hygiene. The option is also available to be fully managed 24/7 by CrowdStrike
security experts through CrowdStrike Falcon Complete™ managed endpoint
security, which comes with a warranty of up to $1 million USD.

Crowdstrike vs SentinelOne

Why customers choose
CrowdStrike vs. SentinelOne

Your network shouldn't be the QA environment! SentinelOne's agent requires a reboot on deployment and cripples systems with high resource requirements, especially under heavy loads. It's difficult to install, needs manual tuning and configuration, and requires exclusions to deal with software interoperability and quality control issues. CrowdStrike requires 70% less hours to maintain. Our platform delivers value from day one. Our single lightweight agent deploys in minutes to hundreds of thousands of users with no reboot required and no manual tuning.


Time matters, don't waste it. SentinelOne's agent upgrades are manual and known to fail. Every device - from remote laptops to critical servers - needs to be carefully updated for new capabilities and protections against emerging attacks. CrowdStrike difference
Our platform updates automatically, providing continuous security with significantly simpler operations, letting security teams focus on stopping attacks, not maintaining infrastructure.

With autonomous, you're alone. Adversaries are outsmarting machines, SentinelOne's over-reliance on autonomous capabilities results in false positive, leaving customers to sift through low-fidelity alerts. Without integrated threat intelligence and world-class services augmenting technology you're on your own. CrowdStrike customers benefit from the industry's most awarded platform with the best threat intelligence and end-to-end managed services. We track 200+ known adversaries and publish 200,000 new IOCs per day

Compare Crowdstrike and SentinelOne
	Deployment
Crowdstrike has seemless Deployment Enables Complete Protection on Day One
Single lightweight agent deploys in minutes and is immediately operational — no reboot or tedious tuning required. SentinelOne has Burdensome Deployment Delays Time to Value
Full platform functionality requires multiple heavy agents, reboots on deployment, and manual exclusions due to software interoperability, with no ability to automatically update sensors.

	Detection Capabilities
Crowdstrike Falcon has comprensive detection, fewer false positives. Superior enterprise-grade visibility and detection across on-premises, cloud, and mobile devices to discover and hunt advanced threats without drowning analysts in a deluge of false positives or a mile-long list of exclusions. SentinelOne is Not Equipped for Modern Threat Detection
SentinelOne’s Next-gen Antivirus-based threat detection engine struggles to detect sophisticated multi-stage attacks, fileless attacks, and attacks that do not require malicious code execution. Their detection engine is also prone to false positives.

	Advanced Analytics
Crowdstrike Falcon has  Analytics Across the Entire Platform
Harness the power of AI and automation across our entire ecosystem, enabling analysts to benefit from local agent AI detections, behavioral AI detections in the cloud, and AI-alerted indicators from threat hunting. CrowdStrike processes trillions of endpoint telemetry events per week and publishes 200,000 new IOCs daily. SentinelOne has Ineffective Automation and AI
Automation and AI is applied primarily at the sensor level like traditional AV, and not across the full ecosystem and platform. This inability to automatically correlate detections across data sources in the cloud hinders true XDR.

	Threat Intelligence
Crowdstrike is a global leader in threat intel. Fully integrated, world-class threat intelligence leverages the power of big data and AI, as well as human expertise, to arm teams with maximum context. Leverage a list of recently published IOCs, adversary attribution and an automated malware sandbox, all within a single user interface. SentinelOne is lagging in threat intel. Check-box threat intelligence functionality primarily built on 3rd party feeds that delivers minimum value. SentinelOne’s threat intelligence delivers a fraction of the IoCs, no adversary attribution, no adversary tactic discovery, and no integrated malware sandbox.

	XDR
Crowdstrike provides a Complete XDR Solution. Built on industry-leading EDR with native threat intel, SOAR, and identity protection, as well as a robust CrowdXDR Alliance to ingest data and take action across key network, cloud, identity, and email domains. SentinelOne has a partial XDR vision. Next-gen Antivirus masked as XDR exclusively delivers automated enrichment and contextualization only for SentinelOne-generated alerts. Unlike true XDR, SentinelOne cannot create alerts based on low fidelity signals from 3rd party telemetry.

	Managed Detection and Response
Crowdstrike has an All-Inclusive MDR
Fastest and most powerful turnkey MDR in the market includes full-cycle remediation and requires no additional personnel resourcing. CrowdStrike had the highest detection coverage out of all participants in 2022 MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation for Managed Services. SentinelOne has Limited MDR
SentinelOne MDR analysts require threat detection before involvement, and response is limited to remediation guidance. Managed threat hunting requires a separate SKU.

SCATTERED SPIDER Exploits Windows Security Deficiencies with Bring-Your-Own-Vulnerable-Driver Tactic in Attempt to Bypass Endpoint Security


In December 2022, CrowdStrike reported on a campaign by SCATTERED SPIDER, targeting organizations within the telecom and business process outsourcing (BPO) sectors with an end objective of gaining access to mobile carrier networks.
In the weeks since that post, the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform prevented a novel attempt by SCATTERED SPIDER to deploy a malicious kernel driver through a vulnerability (CVE-2015-2291) in the Intel Ethernet diagnostics driver.
The activity exploits a well known and pervasive deficiency in Windows security that enables adversaries to bypass Windows kernel protections with the Bring-Your-Own-Vulnerable-Driver tactic. 
CrowdStrike Services has observed the actor attempting to bypass other endpoint tools including Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR and SentinelOne using more traditional defense evasion techniques targeting Windows registry hives.
Introduction 
In December, CrowdStrike reported that beginning in June 2022, the CrowdStrike Services, CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatch™ and CrowdStrike Intelligence teams observed an increase in the targeting of telco and BPO industries. CrowdStrike Intelligence attributed this campaign with low confidence to the SCATTERED SPIDER eCrime adversary. 

SCATTERED SPIDER (aka Roasted 0ktapus, UNC3944) leverages a combination of credential phishing and social engineering to capture one-time-password (OTP) codes or overwhelms targets using multifactor authentication (MFA) notification fatigue tactics. Having obtained access, the adversary avoids using unique malware, instead favoring a wide range of legitimate remote management tools to maintain persistent access. 

In the weeks since that blog post, the Falcon platform detected a novel attempt by this adversary to deploy a malicious kernel driver through a vulnerability (CVE-2015-2291) in the Intel Ethernet diagnostics driver for Windows (iqvw64.sys).

Microsoft Windows Security Deficiencies Leave Devices Vulnerable
This vulnerability has been used by adversaries for several years to deploy malicious drivers into the Windows kernel. This technique is known as “Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver” (BYOVD) and is a tactic that has persisted due to a gap in Windows security. 

In an attempt to limit the amount of capabilities that malware can gain access to on a Windows system, starting with 64-bit Windows Vista, Windows does not allow unsigned kernel-mode drivers to run by default. BYOVD “makes it easy for an attacker with administrative control to bypass Windows kernel protections,” allowing an adversary to install a legitimately signed but malicious driver to execute an attack. Publicly available tools, such as KDMapper, allow adversaries to easily take advantage of BYOVD to map non-signed drivers into memory.

In 2021, Microsoft stated that “Increasingly, adversaries are leveraging legitimate drivers in the ecosystem and their security vulnerabilities to run malware,” and that “drivers with confirmed security vulnerabilities will be blocked on Windows 10 devices in the ecosystem using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint attack surface reduction (ASR) and Microsoft Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) technologies to protect devices against exploits involving vulnerable drivers to gain access to the kernel.”  

However, as noted by multiple security researchers (e.g., here, here and here) over the past two years, the issue continues to persist as Microsoft fails to block vulnerable drivers by default.

In this instance, the adversary attempted to load a malicious driver that was prevented from running and quarantined by CrowdStrike Falcon® Prevent machine learning (ML) and identified by Falcon OverWatch. This driver is designed to use the privileged driver space provided by the vulnerable Intel driver to overwrite specific routines in the CrowdStrike Falcon sensor driver with adversary-created trampoline code. While this was prevented by the Falcon sensor and immediately escalated to the customer with human analysis, a series of recommendations to protect Microsoft kernel memory can be found in the “Recommendations” section below.  

In the past months, CrowdStrike Services has observed the actor attempting to bypass other endpoint tools including Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR and SentinelOne.

Technical Analysis 
CrowdStrike has identified various versions of a malicious driver that are signed by different certificates and authorities — including stolen certificates originally issued to NVIDIA and Global Software LLC, as well as a self-signed test certificate. The intent of the adversary is to disable the endpoint security products visibility and prevention capabilities so the actor can further their actions on objectives.

Versions of the sample are small, 64-bit Windows kernel drivers with less than 35 relatively simple functions.






CrowdStrike Named a Leader in Frost & Sullivan’s 2022 Frost Radar for Cyber Threat Intelligence
December 20, 2022 Kurt Baker Research & Threat Intel <

CrowdStrike is excited to announce we have been recognized by Frost & Sullivan as a global leader in the Frost Radar™ Global Cyber Threat Intelligence Market, 2022 analysis. Earlier this year, CrowdStrike was named a leader in the 2022 SPARK Matrix for Digital Threat Intelligence Management by Quadrant Knowledge Solutions; last year, we were named a leader in The Forrester Wave™: External Threat Intelligence Services, Q1 2021.

These industry recognitions validate CrowdStrike’s continued innovation and delivery of comprehensive cyber threat intelligence capabilities with a strong value proposition. As a result, all organizations, regardless of size or expertise, can easily operationalize intelligence within the security operations center (SOC), monitor malicious activity outside of their perimeter and receive best-of-breed intelligence reporting with analysis backed by a trusted team of intelligence professionals.

Threat Intelligence Keeps CISOs Ahead of Attacks 
The 2022 CrowdStrike Global Threat Report reveals stark examples of the increasing sophistication and speed of adversary attacks: 62% of cyberattacks have become malware-free, interactive intrusions rose 45% year-over-year and the average breakout time dropped to 98 minutes. 

These trends pose substantial challenges to CISOs and their teams and are driving demand for threat intelligence. Security teams are hampered by a lack of resources and expertise. They require new solutions and insights that help keep them ahead of the quickly evolving threat landscape and deliver more effective detection and faster response to attacks.

Threat intelligence empowers CISOs and their security teams to strategize and take action on threats specific to their organization. When the inevitable attacks happen, this approach complements traditional preventive controls by providing an understanding of “who, when and how.” It also helps organizations prioritize investment in defenses against future attacks. 

It’s important to remember that it’s not enough to “set it and forget it” when it comes to successfully adopting threat intelligence. Threat intelligence must be integrated into the SOC workflow, correlated to the latest vulnerability information, and most importantly, trusted by the entire security team to continuously provide timely, unique and relevant threat insights. Developing defensive strategies solely based upon publicly sourced, low-fidelity, after-the-fact intelligence exposes the organization to even more risks and unnecessary costs. 

CrowdStrike’s Threat Intelligence Stands Alone
In its report, Frost & Sullivan takes a deep look into the 13 most significant threat intelligence providers and recognizes that “unlike most vendors on the Frost Radar, CrowdStrike can leverage client threat telemetry from deployments of its endpoint solution.” This is a critical differentiator.

CrowdStrike delivers intelligence across the spectrum of use cases, while providing unique intelligence made possible by our expansive data collection strategy. This starts with the trillions of high-fidelity events per day collected by the CrowdStrike Security Cloud, which powers the protection of millions of endpoints across the globe and provides visibility into real-time and zero-day attacks. This telemetry enables CrowdStrike to track adversaries and their attacks around the world and is the key ingredient that makes the threat intelligence we deliver to our customers the most accurate, timely and unique.

Our comprehensive collection strategy, with the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform at its core, underscores CrowdStrike’s ability to collect data that no one else can, resulting in threat intelligence no other vendor can provide.

Threat Intelligence for Everyone
The impact and operationalization of threat intelligence can differ across organizations and is typically dependent on the size and skills of the security team. For many organizations early in their intelligence journey, “threat intelligence” may simply describe indicators of compromise (IOCs) to block or open-source news alerts sent when a new cyberattack happens. As organizations mature, their needs expand to include enriched context for detections, threat hunting and investigation, dark web monitoring and malware sandboxing. As intelligence becomes more strategic, CISOs and board members may have questions that require in-depth research from a dedicated cyber threat intelligence team.

The CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence suite provides comprehensive coverage of threat intelligence use cases, enabling customers to adopt just the right set of intelligence capabilities for where they are on their journey, with the ability to easily expand as they grow. This suite is broken into three modules, addressing the following outcomes:

Automated, actionable intelligence: The Falcon Intelligence suite is the only solution in the Frost Radar analysis that is built into an industry-leading security platform. Our intelligence goes beyond powering Falcon platform detections and informing our machine learning models. It is seamlessly available in the team’s workflow, enriching other CrowdStrike modules with insights. In addition, CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence automates time-consuming incident investigations and places the resulting insights at the user’s fingertips, thereby empowering SOC teams to make better, faster security decisions.

Visibility into active external threats: As organizations lock down their environments they begin to look outside the perimeter, requiring visibility into external risk. CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence Recon enables security teams to identify and mitigate threats such as brand impersonation, lost or stolen data, and credentials for sale in underground markets.

Building a strategic defense: To gain an advantage over the adversary, organizations need a team of experts to track their activity, understand their capabilities and expose their campaigns. Yet the cost of such a team is beyond the scope of most organizations. The CrowdStrike Intelligence team tracks down hundreds of adversaries across eCrime, nation-state and hacktivism and provides their insights to our customers. CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence Premium delivers industry-leading research that exposes threats against businesses. 

Threat intelligence is part of CrowdStrike’s DNA and has been a cornerstone from the day the company was founded. CrowdStrike not only collects and produces intelligence, it also continuously consumes it to strengthen every Falcon module. This integrated approach results in threat intelligence that helps customers understand their threat profile from an adversary perspective to keep them ahead of the next attack, prioritize future investments and maximize ROI of existing threat risk mitigation initiatives.

Security Guidance from the Front Lines of Cloud Incident Response
June 15, 2023 Editorial Team Endpoint & Cloud Security <
In our first-ever Cloud Threat Summit, CrowdStrike’s Senior Vice President of Intelligence and Senior Director of Consulting Services discussed the most common ways adversaries breach the cloud and the steps organizations can take to stay safe.

An insightful and engaging conversation during last week’s Cloud Threat Summit featured Adam Meyers, Senior Vice President of Intelligence, and James Perry, Senior Director of Consulting Services, sharing real-world stories of cloud breaches and how they inform best practices for stopping cloud-focused adversaries. Their experience in helping customers navigate cloud security incidents can help organizations fortify their cloud defenses. 

In his years of incident response engagements, James has had a front-row seat to the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) cloud-conscious adversaries use in their attacks. Today’s threat actors have grown adept at breaching enterprise cloud environments and silently moving through them, escalating privileges and accessing sensitive data they can use to further their nefarious agendas — often without the victim’s knowledge. 

CrowdStrike’s Incident Response Services and Threat Intelligence teams work closely during and after incidents, sharing valuable information about the adversary and their traits, capabilities and tactics. In response to the increase in cloud-conscious cyberattacks, the IR Services team has developed cloud specialists. This group consists of experts who have built cloud environments for large corporations, and been trained in incident response; it also consists of incident response experts who have been trained in cloud technology and vernacular. 

“We bring those two skill sets together when a customer has a cloud breach, and that really helps us translate the problems they’re having to execs in an organization,” said James. 

Like the IR Services team, today’s organizations must prepare themselves for cloud-focused attacks. Here, we’ll dig into the key themes of this conversation about cloud threat activity and best security practices.  

Neglecting MFA Opens the Door to Attackers
Many businesses still use credentials with simple passwords and no multifactor authentication (MFA) or have misconfigured access policies that allow attackers to break in without an MFA prompt. The most common error he sees is organizations allowlisting their corporate subnets for no MFA. This would allow an attacker that gains endpoint access to quickly pivot into the cloud, often gaining the “more destructive” access the cloud can provide, James said. Organizations often don’t realize adversaries will use their initial access to breach a victim’s identity system, which allows them into many other applications — including the cloud.

“They want to make things easy for their users, but it also makes things very easy for the attackers,” he said.

Allowing users to provision their own MFA is an issue as well. When you create cloud-only accounts and don’t provision MFA, a threat actor can brute-force the account and register their own device so they can log in with MFA. In some cases, the attacker gains access to an admin account and adds an allowlist for their own IP address to bypass MFA. In others, they abuse certificate-based authentication and enroll their own certificate, which is hard to detect.

“You can reset passwords all you want, but if they have a certificate-based authentication, they can come right back in,” he added.

Adversaries will take the path of least resistance — and the cloud is becoming that path. Consider eCrime adversary SLIPPY SPIDER, or Lapsus Group, which in Summer 2022 was able to breach a trillion-dollar company with just one compromised credential and get all the way into the source code. Credentials are keys, and adversaries have their eyes on them.

Some threat actors will use their initial access to find tools they can use to their advantage. James and Adam discussed the recent trend of adversaries using the capabilities of Azure to execute commands on systems hosted in Azure. Last summer, eCrime threat actor SCATTERED SPIDER used this method to push publicly available remote access tools to every host in the environment they could access. Their persistence in the cloud allowed them to lurk on systems across the environment. An attack like this is tough to detect. It takes expertise in cloud, adversaries and intelligence to understand an adversary may do something like this. 

Log Management: Critical to Cloud Security
As organizations interconnect different clouds, Adam predicts they’ll run into the problem of adversaries moving from one cloud to another to better conceal their activity, and reemerge in different ways to catch their victims off-guard. “That’s going to be an interesting dynamic, if they start to do that,” he said.

This use of multiple clouds also leads to the challenge of managing logs, James added. You’ll have different logs coming from different clouds, in addition to on-premises logs. If you’re operating in multiple environments giving different signals, you need the right way to correlate that information and respond to it.

“I think that’s going to be one of the big challenges you see in the future,” he said. “Customers had all the right data but they didn’t have it in the right place; they didn’t have the ability to search it all quickly and see there was an issue.” 

Adam advises organizations to diversify the applications and tools they use to protect their workloads running in multiple clouds. “One of the things I always tell organizations is, don’t put all your eggs in one basket,” he said. If all of your eggs are in one basket and an attacker gets into that basket, they could simply turn protections off. Make sure you have a third party for that essential cloud workload protection — for endpoint protection.

If you’re using one vendor for your productivity suite, you shouldn’t also use it for enterprise security — instead, rely on a third party with expertise in that area. “You get some diversity that way and you’re not beholden to one flaw that could ruin the whole thing,” Adam said.   

Secure the Cloud: Three Best Practices
Three pieces of advice James has for organizations eager to strengthen their cloud security are:

It all starts with hygiene: The cloud is secure — until you go in and start making configuration changes. Many admins don’t have the same in-depth knowledge of the cloud that they have for on-premises infrastructure. Ask yourself: Is your cloud clean? Are any common misconfigurations putting your organization at risk? Are resources exposed to the cloud that shouldn’t be? Basic hygiene is essential to stopping cloud-conscious adversaries.

Identity must be a priority: Make sure you understand your identities — your on-premises identities tied to Active Directory, your cloud identities, your cloud-only accounts. Understand how those are configured, who has access to what, and whether MFA is enabled. Review conditional access policies: Who can access your cloud? From where? What identity policies are enforced on that access?
Implement cloud-to-endpoint protection: Organizations need active protection on cloud and endpoint. Today’s adversaries will find that path of least resistance, whether that means logging into a cloud environment or pivoting from endpoint to cloud. Ensure they can be stopped before they cause a big problem. 

You don’t have a cloud problem — you have an adversary problem, and the key for defenders is to make attacks more difficult and expensive for them. The more barriers you have in place, the harder you can make it for adversaries to achieve their goals. When they slip up, you’ll be able to quickly take notice and respond.
